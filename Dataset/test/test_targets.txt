2,"The two massive earthquakes that hit off the coast of Sumatra in April caused only a fraction of the deaths and damage of 2004 ' s killer quake , but scientists now realize they were part of a momentous change in the planet ' s surface , the BBC reports. Researchers believe the quakes , the strongest of which was a magnitude 8.7 , were part of the break-up of the vast Indo-Australian tectonic plate , which will eventually split into two pieces. The main quake broke four faults and triggered more large aftershocks further away than any other quake ever recorded. story continues below "" It was jaw-dropping , "" a professor of planetary sciences tells the Los Angeles Times. "" It was like nothing we ' d ever seen. "" The main quake did not cause a devastating tsunami because the rock moved horizontally along the breakage instead of vertically.

5,"In 2010 , Michigan ' s Upper Peninsula recorded its first-ever earthquake when a large crack opened in the ground near the city of Menominee , according to a press release from Michigan Technological University. Now researchers finally know what caused the mysterious Menominee Crack. Sort of. Live Science reports the crack  360 feet long and 5 feet deep  showed up accompanied by a "" deep boom "" and the rattling of nearby homes. The earthquake that occurred along with it it measured less than a magnitude 1. For years , no one was sure what to make of the crack , which appeared atop a large limestone ridge. That area of Michigan is considered "" aseismic , "" and there is no earthquake fault under the crack. Besides , any earthquake large enough to cause the crack would have done more than shake a few homes. story continues below Researchers now believe the crack is a geological feature known as a "" pop-up , "" according to a study published this week in Seismological Research Letters. Basically , the bedrock limestone "" violently heaved upward , "" creating the bulge and a resulting crack as the surface stretched , Live Science explains. But that opens up an entirely new mystery. Pop-ups are caused when a large amount of downward pressure on the rock layer below the soil is suddenly lessened. So far , they ' ve only been found at the bases of quarries and areas where glaciers have recently receded. But there are no quarries near the Menominee Crack , and Michigan hasn ' t seen a glacier in more than 11,000 years. "" As far as we can tell , this is a one-of-a-kind event , "" research leader Wayne Pennington says in the press release. "" The earth is still full of surprises , "" he tells Live Science.

9,"People who saw a fireball blaze across Midwest skies early Wednesday were witnessing the death of a Russian satellite , not a meteor or a UFO , according to researchers who track objects in orbit. The American Meteor Society , which encourages people to report fireball sightings , says it received more than 80 reports about the object from nine states including Michigan , Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , West Virginia , and Tennessee , per USA Today. Witnesses said it burned in green , gold , and pink and broke up into smaller pieces during its descent from orbit , reports the New York Times. It was last seen heading over the Great Lakes toward Canada , and experts believe all of the debris burned up before it hit the ground. story continues below Ohio resident Stephanie Neal tells the Times that she initially thought it was a plane crash. "" This thing was so bright , and so big , and it was so much slower than a meteor , "" she says.

Look no further than the one in the Indian Ocean in 2004 that killed more than 230,000 people after being triggered by a powerful earthquake , notes a post at Phys.org. But what if tsunamis could be drained of their power before they reach land ? A mathematician at Cardiff University in Wales is looking at just that possibility , and he reports in the journal Heliyon that firing acoustic-gravity waves at a tsunami could do the trick by reducing the killer wave ' s energy and size while it ' s still far out at sea. AGWs are naturally occurring , deep-ocean sound waves that can stretch for hundreds of miles and move at the speed of sound. story continues below "" Up until now , little attention has been paid to trying to mitigate tsunamis and the potential of acoustic-gravity waves remains largely unexplored , "" says Cardiff ' s Usama Kadri.

The trick is "" developing some sort of underwater cannon  or modulator  capable of generating AGW frequency blasts , "" explains UPI. Like tsunamis , AGWs also can be generated by earthquakes , and Kadri has shown that they can be used as an early warning system against tsunamis. He suggests it might be possible to manipulate one of these quake-generated AGWs as a force against a threatening tsunami , essentially fighting nature with nature.

20,"Since a deadly 2015 earthquake , Nepal ' s 2,600 trekking companies have had to lower their rates to attract a smaller pool of explorers eyeing Himalayan peaks. They ' ve made up for the lost income with what a government report describes as a multimillion-dollar insurance scam involving tour operators , helicopter companies , hotels , and even hospitals , reports Outside. Nepal ' s tourism ministry on Sunday issued new rules requiring the submission of rescue invoices to a government committee after the report found operators encouraged trekkers to abandon climbs for the slightest of reasons , then pressured them into taking expensive helicopter rides to hospitals , which overbilled insurers , per the Guardian. In some cases , guides even served trekkers food laced with laxatives to sicken them , per the report. story continues below Hired to investigate why 2017 was the most expensive year for some insurers , British trekker Danny Kaine says a guide "" became quite aggressive "" in suggesting a helicopter rescue when he complained of a headache on a five-day trek to Mount Everest ' s base camp. "" My final bill was $ 12,800  for a headache , "" Kaine tells the Guardian. "" They are losing money on each trek and need to make it up , "" he adds , noting some travelers were paid more than their $ 500 trek fee to feign illness. Another hiker suspects an operator pocketed $ 35,000 by telling 10 people flown together to a Kathmandu hospital ( because one had a common cold ) to claim they had each traveled alone , per Outside. That way , the bill was for 10 helicopter rides , not one. Several insurers had threatened to pull out of Nepal if the country didn ' t act to interfere in the scam by Sept. 1.

21,"Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere , per Reuters , and the situation there worsened drastically on Wednesday with the overnight assassination of President Jovenel Moise in his home. There are no updates yet on the suspected identity of the gunmen , some of whom were reportedly overheard speaking Spanish ( Haiti is French-speaking ) during the 1am attack , nor on the condition of Moise ' s wife , Martine Moise , who was also shot. The latest developments , plus context : CNN initially reported that the line of succession was unclear , in that typically the president of Haiti ' s Supreme Court would assume the role as president in this case , but Rene Sylvestre recently died of COVID and was due to be buried today. Moise had just on Monday named a new prime minister , Ariel Henry , who was tasked with preparing for presidential and legislative elections slated for Sept. 26. His predecessor , acting Prime Minister Claude Joseph , has apparently taken the leadership role , though the New York Times notes it ' s unclear "" how long [ that ] might last. "" Technically , Joseph can ' t replace Moise , because he would need Parliament ' s OK to do so. That ' s a problem. CNN paints an overall scene of "" political instability , with many key roles in the country ' s government already empty and the Parliament effectively defunct. "" Didier Le Bret , a former French ambassador to Haiti , echoes that : "" There is no more Parliament , the Senate is missing for a long time , there ' s no president of the Court of Cassation. "" story continues below The Washington Post explains the nitty-gritty of Moise ' s much-debated term length. The opposition ( and constitutional scholars and legal experts as well ) maintained his five-year term was up on Feb. 7 , 2021. By Moise ' s count , he had one more year to go. The 2015-2016 presidential election was such a contentious mess that Moise wasn ' t sworn in until Feb. 7 , 2017. He says the five-year clock started then ; opposition groups say it started on Feb. 7 , 2016 , the day his predecessor , Michel Martelly , stepped down. The US State Department agreed with Moise ' s view. He has been ruling by decree since January 2020 , the point when parliamentary terms expired and scheduled elections didn ' t take place. There was an uproar in the streets after his non-exit in February , and 23 people were arrested on Feb. 7 and accused of plotting to assassinate Moise. "" The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life , "" Moise then said , per the Post. "" That plan was aborted. "" The US Embassy in Port-au-Prince issued a security alert that reads , "" Due to an ongoing security situation , the US Embassy is restricting its direct-hire US citizen staff to the Embassy compounds in Tabarre until further notice. The Embassy will be closed today , including for consular services. Please avoid unnecessary travel in this area at this time. "" Reuters reports the Dominican Republic is closing its border with Haiti.

22,"A car crash that downed power lines turned the hills northwest of Los Angeles into torches , forcing thousands from their homes and putting entire neighborhoods at risk in the prosperous semi-rural enclave of Calabasas , reports the AP. Fifty-foot-high flames erupted on the ridges and embers turned trees into candles Saturday afternoon. And while the flames eased overnight , firefighters continued Sunday to battle the blaze. Some 3,000 homes were threatened and about 5,000 residents were evacuated , the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department said. The fire flared as Southern California sweltered under temperatures that hit the mid-90s in many places. At its height , the flames put about 3,000 homes at risk , although not under imminent threat , fire officials said. "" We ' re dealing with a fire that ' s moving in every direction simultaneously ... we can ' t get to everybody , "" Battalion Chief Dennis Cross told KNBC-TV. "" It ' s hard for people to see where this fire is because of the dense canopy and the canyons.

Keith Mora said. Some other buildings , including some at a city park , also were damaged. The fire started as three blazes that erupted after a car hit a power pole and knocked down electrical lines. One fire in the West Hills area of Los Angeles was quickly doused but blazes in Calabasas joined and raced through drought-dry brush in hills surrounded by developments. The blaze grew to 200 acres in a matter of hours. Embers ignited trees and clumps of brush within yards of million-dollar homes. Smoke could be seen for miles. Around 200 firefighters , aided by bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters , had the blaze 15 % contained by late Saturday night. ( Read more fire stories. )"
23,"In the immediate aftermath of North Korea ' s sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3 , experts described the blast as six or seven times as powerful as the one that destroyed Hiroshima. That measure might not even come close. According to research site 38 North , the resulting 6.1 magnitude earthquake must have been caused by the release of roughly 250 kilotons , or a quarter megaton , of energy  equivalent to 17 times the strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima , and very near the estimated maximum yield that can be contained at the Punggye-ri underground test site , report the Washington Post and Bloomberg. This assessment tops all others so far : US intelligence said the blast was 140 kilotons , while South Korea said it was 50 kilotons. story continues below Pyongyang says it tested a hydrogen bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile , but South Korea ' s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission has been unable to confirm that. Though the commission found the xenon-133 isotope in air samples collected after the nuclear test , other radioactive isotopes normally present during a nuclear explosion weren ' t detected , reports the AP. Tritium , traces of which are typically found after a hydrogen bomb is detonated , was one of those noticeably absent. That doesn ' t mean the North is misleading the international community , however.

The country ' s Supreme Court ruled Friday that Uber drivers are workers , not independent contractors , and are entitled to minimum wage and vacation time , the BBC reports. Uber  which appealed to the court after losing two appeals in lower courts  argues that the ruling only applies to a few dozen drivers who used the app in 2016 , but lawyers say there will be a flood of similar lawsuits unless the ruling is applied to all the company ' s drivers.

40,"As the climate warms , scientists are conducting experiments around the world to try to boost drought resistance in a wide range of crops. But a study out of the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science in Japan is especially promising because the key ingredient helping a wide range of crops survive severe drought is cheap and readily available : vinegar. Reporting in the journal Nature Plants , the researchers say that plants grown in drought conditions and treated with water or other organic acids all died  but 70 % of those treated with just acetic acid ( vinegar ) lived. story continues below The study came about because scientists are trying to understand why a mutation to an enzyme called HDA6 in Arabidopsis plants makes them so drought resistant , reports Phys.org. In normal conditions , HDA6 represses the production of acetic acid. During a drought , HDA6 is involved in a biological pathway that actually produces acetate , a salt that is a byproduct of acetic acid. In the Arabidopsis plants that are drought resistant , that pathway is extra active , producing far more acetate , reports Popular Science. Sure enough , in what Modern Farmer reports "" could be a hugely important discovery , "" vinegar helped multiple crops in this study , including rice , wheat , and maize , survive drought-like conditions. Researchers say vinegar would be a far simpler and less costly solution than , say , genetically modifying most plants. ( More than 100 million trees recently died in California. )"

Posted online Friday , the report looks at 79 mission-critical installations across the Army , Air Force , and Navy , but not the Marine Corps. The report says recurrent flooding threatens 53 of the 79 bases , while drought is affecting 43 and wildfires 36 ; other bases are projected to face similar threats in the future. "" It is relevant to point out that ' future ' in this analysis means only 20 years in the future , "" the report says , per Politico. "" Projected changes will likely be more pronounced at the mid-century mark ; vulnerability analyses to mid- and late-century would likely reveal an uptick in vulnerabilities ( if adaptation strategies are not implemented ) . "" story continues below Critics are slamming the report for lacking legally required specifics like cost estimates for base upgrades ; they ' re also asking why Marine Corps bases were left out. "" The report reads like an introductory primer and carries about as much value as a phonebook , "" says Sen. Jack Reed. The Pentagon says its goal was to focus on installations where current US missions are most jeopardized : "" By using this alternative approach , we are able to highlight where there are operational risks , "" per a Pentagon spokeswoman. Either way , Vox says the report  which echoes earlier Pentagon warnings about climate change threatening US military effectiveness  will likely have little impact under "" climate change skeptics "" like President Trump and Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Jim Inhofe.

The University of Haifa researchers , who have been excavating Hippos for 15 years , said today that they found a dove-shaped pendant and a woman ' s skeleton under the remains of a roof. They also dug up ancient artillery balls for a huge catapult and a statue ' s marble leg.

88,"Satellite images taken before and after North Korea ' s last nuclear test beneath Mount Mantap show the mountain actually lost elevation. As the Washington Post reports , the depression of a 85-acre area  followed by three subsequent earthquakes over six weeks  shows not only the force of the Sept. 3 blast , but also the toll North Korea ' s nuclear program has taken on the 7,200-foot-tall mountain. It houses the tunnels that make up the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility , which has been the site of each of North Korea ' s six nuclear tests since 2006. Chinese scientists warn further nuclear tests could trigger a collapse and the release of radiation. But though analysts at 38 North say Mount Mantap may be suffering from "" tired mountain syndrome , "" they say North Korea is unlikely to abandon the site any time soon. story continues below "" Tired mountain syndrome "" has previously been observed at other nuclear test sites in the US and Soviet Union. It essentially means a mountain is under such stress that the collapse of cavities or tunnels is possible. In North Korea ' s case , the Sept. 3 blast is likely to have caused "" substantial damage to the existing tunnel network under Mount Mantap , "" analysts say. But as there are "" two other , as yet unused tunnel complexes "" at Punggye-ri , the analysts believe underground nuclear tests will likely continue.

"" The Times notes the storm ' s maximum sustained winds are currently clocking in at 130mph , with expectations that number will increase. For the storm to be classified Category 5 , they ' d need to hit 157mph. CBS News on Tuesday cited an analysis by CoreLogic that put the possible financial toll of Hurricane Florence at $ 170 billion , with roughly 750,000 homes and businesses damaged. That would outpace Hurricane Katrina ( $ 161 billion in losses ) and Hurricane Harvey ( $ 125 billion ) . CBS News also takes a look at the home insurance situation , noting homeowners are well past the window for adding flood insurance , which has a 30-day waiting period. Wind damage is usually covered , but it notes that in the wake of Hurricane Sandy , many insurers tweaked their policies to bump up deductibles and limit coverage , especially in the event the damage is caused by a hurricane.

123,"The largest tsunami in Hawaii ' s recorded history struck in 1946. Now , scientists have uncovered evidence that they say indicates the 8-foot wall of water was dwarfed by one as much as 30 feet high that came centuries before. The discovery of the Makauwahi sinkhole on Kauai in the late ' 90s ultimately led to the new theory : A little more than 6 feet below the surface of the collapsed limestone cave was a sediment layer flavored by the sea : It contained bits of coral , mollusk shells , and sand. Its mouth , however , was about 325 feet from shore and blocked by a 23-foot wall , according to a press release. The paleoecologist who found it couldn ' t reconcile those figures with Hawaii  s current tsunami evacuation maps , which were based on the 1946 tsunami. That one was triggered by an 8.6-magnitude quake in the Aleutian Islands and would have sent water only about 8 feet up the sinkhole ' s wall. story continues below But Japan ' s devastating 2011 earthquake led scientists to do some new modeling. Per the study , they determined that an Aleutian quake with a "" moment magnitude of ~9.25 "" could create a wall of water between 26 and 30 feet  enough to make its way into the sinkhole. Radiocarbon dating of marine deposits from the sinkhole , Sedanka Island in the Aleutians , and along the West Coast indicate a tsunami occurred between 350 and 575 years ago , though the dating doesn ' t prove it was a single tsunami.

And he ' d only reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal once before , at the 2008 US Open. But Muller ' s powerful serve and crisp volleys make him what Nadal called "" uncomfortable "" to play. Nadal entered the match having won 28 consecutive completed sets in Grand Slam play , equaling his personal best and a total exceeded only twice in the Open era. He arrived at the All England Club coming off his record 10th French Open championship , and 15th major trophy overall , and seemed primed to be a factor again at the grass-court tournament.

A new entrant in the "" no "" category emerges from the pages of the journal Meccanica , where Italian researchers suggest that an 8.2-magnitude earthquake that rocked Jerusalem in 33AD both formed the image and distorted the results of radiocarbon dating that was done on the shroud in 1988 , which indicated it was just 728 years old. The Telegraph reports that scientists have previously floated neutron radiation as the way the shroud , said to be the burial cloth of Jesus , came to purportedly bear his image ; similarly , Heritage Daily reports neutron radiation has been suggested as interfering with the dating of the shroud. But no legitimate source of such radiation had been identified. story continues below But Professor Alberto Carpinteri ' s research into piezonuclear fission reactions has led him to believe the earthquake would have produced high-frequency pressure waves in the Earth ' s crust that would have caused those neutrons to be emitted ; the particles then "" induced the image formation on the Shroud ' s linen fibers "" by interacting with the nitrogen atoms in the fabric , explains Carpinteri.

170,"Liz Cheney does indeed appear to be in her final day in a leadership post among House Republicans. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sent a letter to rank-and-file members of the GOP on Monday telling them to expect the vote to happen Wednesday , reports Fox News. Coverage : The vote : "" Having heard from so many of you in recent days , it ' s clear that we need to make a change , "" McCarthy wrote. "" As such , you should anticipate a vote on recalling the Conference Chair this Wednesday.

171,"Tuesday ' s earthquake in Pakistan gave rise to an island roughly half a mile off the coast ; yesterday , locals set off to explore it , and what they describe is an oval-shaped mass no more than 300 feet long  which is emitting some kind of flammable gas. Journalist Bahram Baloch tells the BBC that he and his companions found the mound littered with dead fish , but it ' s the gas that seems most jarring. "" We could hear the hissing , "" he says , and when they put a match to it , flames appeared , and persistent ones at that : "" Not even the water could kill it , unless one poured buckets over it. "" story continues below A Pakistani marine biologist tells Geo TV it ' s methane , and echoed the journalist ' s account : "" Our team found bubbles rising from the surface of the island which caught fire when a match was lit and we forbade our team to start any flame. "" But a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey isn ' t so sure. "" The methane in this region we know about ( is ) deeper and offshore , "" he tells ABC News.

172,"A 2018 study warned that 64,000 Florida homes were at risk to chronic flooding by 2045 because of rising sea levels. The figure rises to 1 million homes by 2100. Now , new research suggests this effect already is showing up in the state ' s real estate market , reports NPR. The volume of home sales in areas most at risk in Florida have dropped along with prices , according to Benjamin Keys and Philip Mulder at Penn ' s Wharton School. They say the downturn started in 2013 , per the New York Times. From that year to 2018 , the volume of homes sold in Florida ' s "" more exposed "" coastal areas fell 16 % to 20 % relative to "" less exposed "" areas , according to the researchers ' working paper. story continues below It took longer for prices to start falling as well , but the researchers say that began in 2018. Since that year , prices of homes in "" more exposed "" areas have dropped compared to those in "" less exposed "" tracts , for a difference of 5 % to 10 % in 2020. This suggests "" fewer buyers are willing to bear [ flooding risks ] at current market prices , "" the authors write , noting Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and a pair of 2014 climate change reports may have played a role. The bottom line is that "" coastal housing is in more distress than we thought , "" Keys tells the Times. Jeff Dorian at the Miami Herald weighs in : "" South Florida can ' t afford any more delays , "" he writes. "" To mitigate sea-level rise , the global emissions curve must be reversed.
