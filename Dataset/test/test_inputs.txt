In her appearance on The View , Lahren said she is pro-choice and called pro-life conservatives hypocrites , saying , I can  t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I  m for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies.

On Monday , founder of The Blaze Glenn Beck  in an unusual move  played a clip of Lahren seemingly flip-flopping on the abortion issue on his radio show. He also argued against Lahren  s stance that pro-life conservatives are hypocrites. I would disagree that you  re a hypocrite if you want limited government and yet you want the government to protect life of the unborn. It  s very , very clear. But it takes intellectual honesty , and it takes a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter or Facebook to get your news and your political opinions. You actually have to study things  these things out in your mind. Especially at a time period like today ,  Beck said. Bomb throwing is  bomb throwing in today  s world is dangerous. Freedom of speech , it  s not free. Speech isn  t free. It comes with a very high price tag. First , being intellectually honest and intellectually curious. Speech is not free. It comes with another cost and usually to the other people at the other end of your argument.

1,"When the Valley fire erupted Saturday afternoon in Lake County , it quickly became clear firefighters weren  t going to be able to keep up. As officials evacuated homes in its path , the blaze would jump ahead of them , threatening more structures before firefighters could advance. Ashes , embers would rain down a quarter- , half-mile behind them ,  said Daniel Berlant , a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. As fire crews would make progress -- hold the fire -- it would burn right past them.  Experts said the Valley fire moved faster than any other in California  s recent past. In less than 12 hours , it had scorched 40,000 acres. Advertisement There aren  t very many fires in California  s history that have done that. I don  t know if there really is a precedent for it ,  said Daniel Swain , a climate scientist at Stanford University. This fire sort of broke the rules even relative to this incredible season that  s already occurred.  In some ways , the Valley fire is the blaze officials have been worried about all summer : the product of drought conditions made all the more dangerous because it burned through dense terrain dotted by small communities. Although other fires this summer have also spread quickly , this one  s path took it through several rural towns that were left defenseless by its speed and size. Dry conditions from four years of drought , experts said , were just one factor that made the Valley fire so difficult to fight. Extremely high temperatures across the state last week , combined with the dried vegetation , allowed the fire to pick up steam in forested areas and then enter towns with a vengeance. The blaze grew so big that it created its own wind and humidity that mimicked the dangerous effects of Santa Ana winds , shooting out embers that spread the fire. It is kind of mind-boggling ,  Swain said. The drought has killed more and more trees each year , making them quick to ignite. An infestation of bark beetles -- which prey on drought-stricken trees -- has also sucked the life from forests across the state. A U.S. Forest Service survey of the region in and around the Bay Area in June found that tree mortality was increasing almost everywhere. But the worst region by far , the survey found , was an area south of Clear Lake -- exactly where the Valley fire is burning. Berlant said triple-digit temperatures last week left the trees tinder dry.  As those temperatures cooled toward the end of the week , winds picked up , which further fanned the flames , he said. The fire broke out about 1 : 30 p.m. Saturday near the community of Cobb , then spread southeast at astonishing speed. In some cases , residents only had minutes to evacuate ,  Berlant said. Nicole Young , who lives in the nearby neighborhood of Hidden Valley Lake , said that while she and her parents were discussing how to safely evacuate with their five horses , they saw flames beginning to creep down a hill. We have to go now ,  Young , 25 , remembers thinking. The sky was already dark with smoke. As her family drove out of the community , she saw a market go up in flames. Her father saw a propane tank explode in front of a house. The fire was all around us ,  she said. Swain , the Stanford scientist , said the blaze was able to grow enough in forested areas that it turned into a firestorm. Then it pushed into small towns in the region , including Middletown. The fire released far-reaching embers that allowed it to jump from structure to structure , and beyond typical barriers such as roads and creeks. Hundreds of homes and other structures were lost , including large parts of Middletown  s main street. Though temperatures dropped and there was even some rain Saturday night , that did nothing to stem the fire  s growth , Berlant said. He said the winds were 20 to 30 mph , but the fire spread as if being fanned by Santa Ana winds , which can blow up to 100 mph. Four firefighters suffered second-degree burns Saturday , he said. More than a dozen fires are raging across California , including some that began in early July. One , the Rough fire -- which is burning in the Sierra National Forest -- has grown to nearly 130,000 acres and is one of the 20 largest fires in California history , Berlant said. The fire behavior this summer is essentially unprecedented ,  Swain said. Unfortunately , that  s very consistent with the climatological picture right now , where we  re seeing a drought of a magnitude that we haven  t seen before.  soumya.karlamangla@latimes.com MORE ON CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES : Middletown suffers a devastating blow Valley fire : Residents of Middletown tell harrowing survival tales Raging Valley and Butte fires spur help , sympathy on social media|||||Fire crews ran night operations and controlled burnings to contain the Butte Fire in Sheep Ranch , on Sept. 12 2015.

The bushes , the trees have absolutely no moisture in them , and the humidities are so low that we are seeing these fire starts  just erupt into conflagrations ,  Mark Ghilarducci , director of the Governor  s Office of Emergency Services , said Sunday after a briefing with fire and emergency officials in Calaveras County , scene of the massive Butte fire that has burned more than 80 homes. The fires are spreading faster than I have seen in my 30 years ,  he said. The Butte fire and the Valley fire in Lake County , in particular , he said , got into people  s lives very , very fast. It is critical our citizens understand for their security that they not only have to clear the property around their homes , but they have to be prepared to evacuate fast.  Ghilarducci said state fire and emergency services operations are doing well , but are stretched and that California has asked for firefighting help from Nevada and Oregon , and has reached out also to Utah , Colorado and Washington states. Nevada already has sent fire crews and aircraft , he said. State fire officials also rely heavily on local fire districts to provide support , typically sending double what Cal Fire sends to fire scenes , Ghilarducci said. If we didn  t have that , we  d be in trouble.  State OES officials are spending Sunday talking with fire and local officials to determine what sort of help the state can provide , aside from fighting fires. That includes housing for what Ghilarducci expects will be a lot of people without homes. The Valley fire in particular , he said , could prove to be devastating to many people. We are going to be amazed at the number of structures lost there ,  he said. This is a large humanitarian impact there. There are people who are going to be homeless. We have to makes sure we address those issues with medium and longer term sheltering.  UPDATE 11 : 10 a.m. At least two dozen homes and an apartment complex have burned to the ground in Middletown , where the Valley fire in Lake County struck Saturday night , but a number of significant structures appear to have escaped damage. The Middletown Bible Church , the high school and the Chevron station along the main drag all appear intact , and active firefighting measures inside the town have ceased. Visibility remains extremely limited , with heavy smoke still covering the area , and it appears that the most damage was in outlying areas despite media reports that most of the town of 1,300 residents was destroyed. Trees and power lines have fallen onto some streets , and a light sprinkling of rain was hitting the area this morning. UPDATE 10 : 50 a.m. Cal Fire announced new mandatory evacuations for the Valley fire. Daniel Berlant , agency spokesman , said on Twitter that Point Lakeview to Soda Bay ( Hwy 281 ) is now under a mandatory evacuation. UPDATE 10 : 25 - 10 : 35 a.m. Some of the thousands of people evacuated from the Butte fire have flocked to shelter at the Jackson Rancheria Casino Resort. We  ve turned the hotel into an evacuation center ,  said Rich Hoffman , CEO of the Jackson Rancheria. In addition to using the hotel space , cots have been brought into the conference space. The RV park is filled up and some people with animals are sleeping in the parking lot with them , Hoffman said. We are just fortunate to have this facility ,  he said. He said the tribe has brought in toys and video game consoles to give the kids something to do. The casino is still open but much of the resources have been diverted for the new mission , Hoffman said. Rough fire The Rough fire in the mountains east of Fresno continues to be the largest active fire in the state with 130,000 acres burned. That fire has swept through areas that contain several ancient and iconic sequoia trees , including the General Grant tree , second largest in the world , and the Boole Tree , sixth largest in the world. Both trees , however , are reported safe. They are all fine ,  fire spokesman Jim Schwarber said Sunday morning. There have been a lot of efforts preparing those areas , removing fuels around them. We had sprinklers set up , so there wouldn  t be serious threat.  The Chicago Stump , part of a large sequoia cut down more than a century ago , was wrapped in foil for protection , Schwarber said. The fire , centered in Kings Canyon east of Fresno , was reported 31 percent contained Sunday morning. Nearly 3,000 firefighters are involved. The lightning-caused fire has been burning since July 31. Fire spokesman Jim Schwarber said the fire  like the Butte and Valley fires - has been spreading faster than computer modeling forecasts projected. The country is bone dry , and we  ve had triple-digit hot weather ,  Schwarber said. We have dry , dead super-flammable fuel.  One firefighter has been injured. An estimated 3,500 people have been evacuated from their homes , but only two buildings are reported destroyed. UPDATE 9 : 50 a.m. Cal Fire  s tally of 86 homes and 51 outbuildings destroyed so far by the Butte fire in Amador and Calaveras counties is expected to grow later Sunday as inspection teams continue their assessments of what damage has been wrought by the 65,000-acre blaze. We are going to see that number grow probably this evening ,  Cal Fire spokesman Mike Mohler said Sunday morning. Meanwhile , firefighters are hoping for a break from the heavy smoke layer that grounded air tankers and helicopters over the fire Saturday. Light rain sprinkles dampened the area early Sunday , and although Mohler said it  s not going to be enough moisture to settle down the fire ,  the sun was becoming visible this morning and air units may be flying again by 11 a.m. Now we have other fires in this region ,  he said. We need to get these people back in their homes and we need to start releasing equipment as soon as possible.  UPDATE 9 : 30 a.m. About 100 firefighters from the Sacramento region have been deployed to three major fires burning in California , including strike teams sent Saturday night to assist in the rapidly growing Valley fire in Lake County. Sacramento Fire Department spokesman Roberto Padilla said strike teams comprised of firefighters from Sacramento , Folsom , Metro Fire , West Sacramento and Cosumnes fire have been deployed to the Valley fire , as well as the Butte fire burning in Amador and Calaveras counties and the Rough fire burning east of Fresno. The latest deployment came Saturday night with units dispatched to Lake County lights and sirens all the way out there at 9 : 30 ,  Padilla said. Those firefighters are headed toward the Hidden Valley Lake area to provide structure protection , although Padilla noted they may be diverted if needed elsewhere. These are extreme conditions , and for us locally these are literally our neighbors ,  Padilla said. Numerous law enforcement officers from regional departments also have been dispatched to provide traffic support and protection of neighborhoods that have been evacuated. One suspected looting incident in San Andreas on Saturday night resulted in one suspect being detained. UPDATE 9 : 17 a.m. Fire officials report thousands  of Calaveras and Amador counties residents have packed seven evacuation shelters in the two counties this weekend as the four-day-old Butte fire continued its course Sunday morning , sweeping through grassy hills. Officials ordered mandatory evacuations Saturday evening on the fringes of Angels Camp. The ( centers ) are swelling ,  Butte fire public information officer Julie Rider said. There had been no reports of serious injuries or deaths yet as a result of the fire. But Rider said a scout team was in the field Sunday identifying and checking destroyed buildings. The official Butte County count from Saturday night stands at 81 homes destroyed and 51 outbuildings , but those numbers are expected to rise. UPDATE 9 a.m. The Harbin Hot Springs Health Spa in Middletown reported evacuating all guests Saturday night but the fate of its buildings remained uncertain. A posting on the spa  s Facebook page noted that all residents and guests were evacuated by mid-afternoon , with the Valley fire moving down from Cobb into our valley.  At this point , reports of damage to our center are rumor , as everyone has left the area. However , the photos and videos from Middletown paint a very grim picture for our community. Send prayers.  UPDATE 8 : 56 a.m. State fire officials say they expect another tough day ahead , fighting fires on numerous fronts , including the Valley fire in Lake County , the Butte fire in Calaveras County and a dozen other wildland fires statewide. They say they are hoping for a bit of a reprieve from the weather. Residents in the Lake County fire area reported a few raindrops Sunday morning. On both fires we are expecting cooler temperatures today , which will be nice ,  CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. But we had cooler temperatures yesterday too , and the fires grew at explosive rates. We  re expecting extreme fire behavior today.  UPDATE 8 : 45 a.m. The four firefighters injured during the early stages of the Valley fire fight Saturday afternoon remain the only reported serious injuries in that fire and at the Butte fire in Calaveras County as of Sunday morning , fire officials said. The four were in stable condition at the University of California , Davis , Medical Center in Sacramento , where they were airlifted Saturday. The Lake County-based firefighting group had been dropped into the fire zone near the community of Cobb by helicopter to build containment lines when the incident occurred , CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. We don  t have the circumstances yet ,  he said. We will activate an accident review team , but with so much immediate threat , fighting the fire has to be our priority right now.  UPDATE 8 : 16 a.m. Gov. Jerry Brown issued a state of emergency Sunday for Lake and Napa counties because of the massive Valley Fire that has scorched 40,000 acres and destroyed an unknown number of homes since it erupted Saturday. The proclamation follows an earlier one the governor made for the Butte fire , which has burned 65,000 acres in Amador and Calaveras counties since Wednesday. Earlier , the state Office of Emergency Services announced that it obtained a Fire Management Assistance Grant overnight from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for Lake and Napa counties that allows agencies fighting the blaze to recover costs from the fire. EARLIER COVERAGE Firefighters gained significant ground on the Butte fire burning in Amador and Calaveras counties overnight , reporting the massive blaze that destroyed at least 86 homes is 20 percent contained. But the Valley fire that started in Lake County Saturday afternoon as a small vegetation blaze mushroomed into a 40,000 acre monster with no containment. The Valley fire , which resulted in burns to four Cal Fire firefighters Saturday , is burning southeast from Cobb toward Middletown and Hidden Valley Lake , Cal Fire reported Sunday morning. There have been an unconfirmed number of structures destroyed ,  Cal Fire said. There are over 5,000 ( residences ) without power. Four firefighters on a helicopter crew were burned Saturday and transported to UC Davis Medical Center , where they were in stable condition Saturday evening with second degree burns. The fire is now being attacked by 1,000 firefighters , 125 engines , four air tankers and 16 bulldozers. The cause of both massive fires  which have scorched more than 164 square miles  remains under investigation. Residents fleeing the Valley fire are being advised to seek shelter at the Kelseyville Presbyterian Church in Kelseyville and the Napa County Fairgrounds in Calistoga. Evacuation centers for the Butte fire include the Jackson Rancheria Hotel , the Jackson Jenny Lind Veterans Hall at 189 Pine St. in Valley Springs and the Good Samaritan Church in Valley Springs.

The blaze with zero containment raced through several towns overnight after exploding in size within hours. An Associated Press photographer reported seeing dozens of homes destroyed and a roughly 40-unit apartment complex burned to the ground. Cal Fire also says at least 5,000 people are without power. Several residents in Middletown say they also have no running water. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in Lake County from state Highway 29 and state Highway 175 to Seigler Canyon Road and for state Highway 29 at state Highway 175 toward Cobb and Red Hills Road to state Highway 29.

The Associated Press and Bay City News contributed to this report|||||A ferocious wildfire in Northern California that has killed an elderly woman , displaced 13,000 residents and destroyed hundreds of homes continued to grow Monday , chewing through 1,000 more acres by the time night fell. The explosive Valley fire , which broke out in Lake County on Saturday , has overwhelmed firefighters who have scrambled to keep up with its unpredictable nature. Consuming 62,000 acres -- about 97 square miles  it prompted the local sheriff to declare it the worst tragedy the area had ever seen. The rain that fell Monday afternoon appeared to be a sign of reprieve , but fire officials warned that that was not the case. The reality is that a fire burning this hot , the falling rain never even makes it to the ground ,  said Doug Pittman , a Cal Fire spokesman. It  s vaporized before it gets to the fire.  Advertisement Pittman added that the landscape has become so desiccated that its response to water , even if sprayed directly on grass and trees , is minimal. A shift in other elements -- such as an increase in humidity or a decrease in wind speed -- would actually be more helpful. The drop in temperature , however , has at least made conditions more comfortable for the 1,800 firefighters on the scene. We  ll take any and all precipitation that we can get ,  Pittman said. Shortly after the Valley fire began in the area of Cobb Mountain , residents began calling police for assistance with evacuations , Lt. Steve Brooks of the Lake County Sheriff  s office said in a statement. Hundreds of homes were evacuated in the first few hours. California fire updates : The latest on the Valley and Butte blazes >> Among the calls was a request that someone attend to a woman who was unable to leave her residence. The call was received by dispatch Saturday at 7 : 12 p.m. , Brooks said. Officers and deputies responded to the area less than 20 minutes later and found the residence already engulfed in flames. Human remains were found after the fire subsided , the statement said. Authorities did not release the woman  s name , but her caretaker identified her to The Times as Barbara McWilliams , 72 , a former special education teacher with advanced multiple sclerosis. The caretaker , Jennifer Hittson , 30 , said McWilliams lived on Cobb Mountain , where even though her health was failing , she enjoyed feeding birds near her well-kept home. A neighbor confirmed that McWilliams  home had burned to the ground , Hittson said. According to Mark Ghilarducci of the Governor  s Office of Emergency Services , state and local agencies are working together to find out more details about her death as well as determining how many people are unaccounted for. Four firefighters injured early in the fight were in stable condition , state fire officials said. We  re really in a battle with nature , and nature is more powerful than we are ,  said Gov. Jerry Brown , who declared a state of emergency in Lake and Napa counties. On Monday he was briefed on wildfires that have devoured tens of thousands of acres in Northern California. Brown called for more funding for firefighting and said the fundamental obligation of government is public safety. This is damn serious stuff ,  he said. As tankers and helicopters waited on standby , flight commanders were unsure Monday whether they would be able to begin an assault on the Valley fire. It is the nightmare we feared ,  said Jeff Tunnell , a federal fire behavior specialist. With just 10 % containment , even structures already ravaged by the fire are still under threat. The way it burned , it left so many pockets , the fire will turn around ,  incident planning chief Rob Daugherty said at a morning briefing with fire personnel. If you saved the house , today you  ll have to save the backside.  At least 400 homes have been destroyed , many of which were in the communities of Middletown and Hidden Valley Lakes. Fire officials expected that number to increase dramatically after crews were able to assess the damage to structures on rugged terrain where access is limited. Although a dense , gray sky helped minimize the spread of the fire Sunday , it also kept aerial crews grounded because of its effect on visibility. We had a hard time actually finding where parts of the fire were ,  Daugherty said. The same cloud cover a day later has crews worried that water and fire retardant drops will be delayed once more. Smoke and dangerous conditions for air surveillance made it difficult for fire officials to assess how far through the hills the Valley fire had burned Sunday and where it had been most destructive. The signature feature of the fire was its early explosive growth , fed by brush and trees dried by drought and last week  s blistering heat. See the most-read stories this hour >> The underlying cause is still under investigation , said Todd Derum , incident chief with Cal Fire. It was reported as a structure fire , but it was outside of the structure ,  Derum said at a community meeting for evacuees held at the Calistoga fairgrounds. He said wind-blown embers quickly began igniting spot fires  half a mile or more away in the drought-dried brush. The fire roared through Middletown in the night. At the height of the blaze , fire hydrants went dry , and by Sunday morning the town , perhaps best known for the nearby clothing-optional Harbin Hot Springs retreat , was filled with smoking ruins. Residents who sneaked past barricades to try to salvage keepsakes estimated that half the town had been destroyed. Entire blocks were burned so thoroughly that it was difficult to tell how many homes they had once held. The path of destruction in places seemed capricious. Tidy new town homes with picket fences stood untouched next to a charred lot where three walls and a fireplace were all that was left. Some landmarks like the Jolly Kone were still standing , but others , including a new elementary school that opened weeks ago and the hot springs resort , had burned. We tried the best we could , but it went structure to structure to structure ,  Derum said. In addition to the Valley fire , a dozen wildfires were burning actively in California. The largest has scorched more than 138,000 acres in the southern Sierra Nevada since it ignited July 31 , according to the U.S. Forest Service. More than 3,200 firefighters are battling the Rough fire , which is 40 % contained and is threatening world-famous sequoia groves in and around Sequoia National Forest , according to the forest agency. The Rough fire is one of hundreds ignited by a series of lightning strikes in California in late July. In Northern California , about 240 fires sparked by lightning collectively burned well over 200,000 acres , according to the Forest Service. The other significant fire to break out recently was the Butte fire , which flared up Wednesday and has since raced through more than 71,000 acres of drought-stricken terrain about 45 miles northeast of Stockton , according to Cal Fire. With containment at 35 % , that fire has destroyed 135 homes and 79 other structures , and Cal Fire officials said it is threatening an additional 6,400 structures , prompting evacuations.

2,""" They are separated by a lot of faults. And if you look on Earth today , between plates you have only one fault. So , the process we are talking about is how we go from several faults to only one fault .|||||Indonesia has responded to a powerful 8.6-magnitude earthquake that struck beneath the ocean floor off the westernmost province of Aceh by issuing a tsunami warning for the entire Indian Ocean. And while it ultimately spawned a wave just 30 inches high that caused no serious damage , there ' s no rest yet for the earthquake-weary country. A hefty 8.2-magnitude aftershock hit about two hours later , reports the AP. That shaker was centered some 380 miles from the provincial capital of Banda Aceh , about 100 miles further than the first. story continues below A 9.1-magnitude earthquake in 2004 triggered a massive tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed 230,000 people , most of them in Aceh. People on Twitter said tremors this time were felt in Singapore , Thailand , Malaysia , and India. High-rise buildings on Malaysia  s west coast shook for at least a minute , and in Indonesia , residents quickly clogged the streets with traffic as they fled to higher ground in cars and on the backs of motorcycles. Damage , thus far , appears to be minimal. ( Read more earthquake stories. )|||||Planet Earth may be 4.5 billion years old , but that doesn  t mean it can  t serve up a shattering surprise now and again. Such was the case on April 11 when two massive earthquakes erupted beneath the Indian Ocean off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra , far from the usual danger zones. Now scientists say the seafloor ruptures are part of a long suspected , yet never before observed , event : the slow-motion splitting of a vast tectonic plate. The first of the quakes , a magnitude 8.7 , was 20 times more powerful than California  s long anticipated big one  and tore a complex network of faults deep in the ocean floor. The violence also triggered unusually large aftershocks thousands of miles away , including four off North America  s western coast. It was jaw-dropping ,  said Thorne Lay , a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. It was like nothing we  d ever seen.  Advertisement At first , Lay wondered whether the computer code he used to analyze earthquakes was wrong. Eventually , he and other scientists realized that they had documented the breakup of the Indo-Australian plate into two pieces , an epic process that began roughly 50 million years ago and will continue for tens of millions more. Lay and other scientists reported their findings online Wednesday in the journal Nature. Most great earthquakes occur along plate borders , where one plate dives beneath the adjoining plate and sinks deep into Earth  s mantle , a process called subduction. The April 11 quakes , however , occurred in the middle of the plate and involved a number of strike-slip faults , meaning the ground on one side of the fault moves horizontally past ground on the other side. Scientists say the 8.7 main shock broke four faults. The quake lasted 2 minutes and 40 seconds  most last just seconds  and was followed by a second main shock , of magnitude 8.2 , two hours later. Unlike the magnitude 9.1 temblor that struck in the same region on Dec. 26 , 2004 , and created a deadly tsunami , the April 11 quakes did not cause similar destruction. That  s because horizontally moving strike-slip faults do not induce the massive , vertical displacement of water that thrust faults do on the borders of plates. The type of interplate faults involved in the Sumatran quakes are the result of monumental forces , some of which drove the land mass of India into Asia millions of years ago and lifted the Himalayan Mountains. As the Indo-Australian plate continues to slide northwest , the western portion of the plate , where India is , has been grinding against and underneath Asia. But the eastern portion of the plate , which contains Australia , keeps on moving without the same obstruction. That difference creates squeezing pressure in the area where the quakes occurred. The study authors say that over time , as more quakes occur and new ruptures appear , the cracks will eventually coalesce into a single fissure. This is part of the messy business of breaking up a plate ,  said University of Utah seismologist Keith Koper , senior author of one of the studies. Most likely it will take thousands of similar large quakes for that to happen.  The quakes were also notable for triggering powerful aftershocks thousands of miles away. Though major quakes have been known to trigger aftershocks at great distance , they are usually less than 5.5 in magnitude. The April earthquakes triggered 11 aftershocks that measured 5.5 or greater in the six days that followed , including a magnitude 7. Remote shocks were felt 6,000 to 12,000 miles from the main quakes. Fred Pollitz , a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park , Calif. , and lead author of one of the studies , said the quakes were extremely effective in transmitting seismic wave radiation around the world. Though Pollitz said the magnitude of the larger Sumatran quake is No. 10 on the list of quakes since 1900 , no other temblor has triggered so many strong aftershocks so far away. It  s the most powerful earthquake ever in terms of capability of putting stress on other fault zones around the world ,  he said. Pollitz said the quakes were likely to teach seismologists about the physics of earthquakes , particularly those along strike-slip faults. That knowledge , he said , would certainly apply to California  s San Andreas fault , which is also a strike-slip fault. Lay said that the Sumatran quakes were most surprising in that they were completely unanticipated by seismologists and that he did not expect the event to repeat any time soon. monte.morin@latimes.com"
3,"Most of the water that fills the world ' s oceans  and makes up more than half of the human body  may have started out as comets , not asteroids as current theories hold , according to new research. Scientists using the Herschel telescope found that unlike other comets studied , the comet Hartley 2 contains water with the same chemical signature as water on our planet , suggesting that cometary impacts brought the water that covered the rocky and dry early Earth , the BBC reports. story continues below Hartley 2 is believed to have formed in the Kuiper belt , not far outside the solar system. Comets studied earlier came from the much more distant Oort cloud and had a different chemical composition , leading scientists to believe only 10 % of Earth ' s water could have come from comets. "" It was a big surprise when we saw the ratio was almost the same as what we find in the Earth ' s oceans , "" the lead researcher tells Reuters. "" It means it is not true any more that a maximum of 10 % of water could have come from comets. Now , in principle , all the water could have come from comets. "" ( Read more comet stories. )|||||Amateur astronomer Michael Mattiazzo of Castlemaine , Australia caught these two images of comet Elenin on Aug. 19 ( left ) and Sept. 6 , 2011. The images show a rapid dimming in the comet , possibly hinting at its disintegration. The moment long feared by conspiracy theorists is nearly upon us : The "" doomsday comet "" Elenin will make its closest approach to Earth Sunday ( Oct. 16 ) . Or what ' s left of it will , anyway. Comet Elenin started breaking up in August after being blasted by a huge solar storm , and a close pass by the sun on Sept. 10 apparently finished it off , astronomers say. So what will cruise within 22 million miles ( 35.4 million kilometers ) of our planet Sunday is likely to be a stream of debris rather than a completely intact comet. And the leftovers of Elenin won ' t return for 12,000 years , astronomers say. "" Folks are having trouble finding it , so I think it ' s probably dead and gone , "" said astronomer Don Yeomans of the Near-Earth Object Program Office at NASA ' s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. [ Gallery : Comet Elenin in Pictures ] That means it probably won ' t present much of a skywatching show Sunday , scientists have said. The doomsday comet Elenin ' s apparent demise may come as a relief to some folks , since apocalyptic rumors circulating on the Internet portrayed the comet as a major threat to Earth. One theory claimed Elenin would set off havoc on Earth after aligning with other heavenly bodies , spurring massive earthquakes and tsunamis. Another held that Elenin was not a comet at all , but in fact a rogue planet called Nibiru that would bring about the end times on Earth. After all , the comet ' s name could be taken as a spooky acronym : "" Extinction-Level Event : Nibiru Is Nigh. "" Those ideas were pure nonsense , Yeomans said. "" Elenin was a second-rate , wimpy little comet that never should have been noted for anything , really , "" he told SPACE.com. "" It was not even a bright one. "" Elenin ' s remains will not be the only objects about to make their closest pass of Earth. One day after the Elenin flyby , the small asteroid 2009 TM8 will zip close by. Like Elenin , it poses no risk of striking our home planet. Asteroid 2009 TM8 is about 21 feet ( 6.4 meters ) wide and the size of a schoolbus. It will come within 212,000 miles of Earth  just inside the orbit of the moon  when it zips by on Monday morning ( Oct. 17 ) . Say goodbye to Elenin Elenin was named after its discoverer , Russian amateur astronomer Leonid Elenin , who spotted it in December 2010. Before the icy wanderer broke up , its nucleus was likely 2 to 3 miles ( 3 to 5 km ) in diameter , scientists say. Elenin never posed any threat to life on Earth , Yeomans said. It was far too small to exert any appreciable influence on our planet unless it managed to hit us. "" Just driving to work every day in my subcompact car is going to have far more of a gravitational effect on Earth than this comet ever will , "" Yeomans said. Elenin ' s supposed connection to earthquakes was just a correlation , and a weak one at that , he added. Relatively strong earthquakes occur every day somewhere on Earth , so it ' s easy  but not statistically valid  to blame some of them on the comet ' s changing position. Yeomans views the frenzy over Elenin as a product of the Internet age , which allows loud and often uninformed voices to drown out the rather more prosaic results that scientists publish in peer-reviewed journals. "" It ' s a snowball effect on the Web , "" Yeomans said. "" You get one or two folks who make an outrageous claim , and a bunch of others pile on. Some folks are actually making a living this way. "" Elenin ' s crumbs will soon leave Earth in the rear-view mirror , speeding out on a long journey to the outer solar system. But Yeomans doesn ' t think the departure will keep the conspiracy theorists down for long. "" It ' s time to move on to the next armageddon , "" he said.

4,"MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican rescuers raced against the clock on Wednesday to save a 12-year-old girl trapped beneath a collapsed school and reach other possible survivors buried in rubble in central Mexico following the country  s most deadly earthquake in three decades. At least 237 people were killed by the 7.1-magnitude quake that struck about 150 km ( 90 miles ) southeast of Mexico City on Tuesday afternoon , 32 years after a 1985 quake killed thousands. Rescue workers were able to communicate with the girl , identified only as Frida Sofia , who responded that there were two other students nearby but she could not tell if they were alive , according to broadcaster Televisa , whose cameras and reporters had special access to the scene. Rescuers previously had seen a hand protruding from the debris , and she wiggled her fingers when asked if she was still alive , Televisa said. The girl  s full name was not made public , but her family waited in anguish nearby , knowing that the bodies of 21 school children and four adults were already recovered from the Enrique Rebsamen School. They and other parents clung to hope after rescue teams reported a teacher and two students had sent text messages from within the rubble. Rescuers moved slowly , erecting makeshift wooden scaffolding to prevent rubble from crumbling further and seeking a path to the child through the unstable ruins. As in rescue scenes throughout the central Valley of Mexico , officials ruled out using heavy equipment as long as there were signs of life below. Some 14 hours after the effort began , rescue workers in hard hats made an urgent plea on camera for beams and chains to support parts of the school ruins that were collapsing. We have a lot of hope that some will still be rescued ,  said David Porras , one of scores of volunteers helping the search at the school for children aged 3 to 14. But we  re slow , like turtles ,  he said. Rescuers periodically demanded total silence  bystanders , who would freeze in place and stay quiet , to better hear calls for help. Similar efforts have pulled more than 50 survivors from buildings around the country , President Enrique Pena Nieto said in a national address. Such rescues lead to impassioned cries of Yes we can !  from responders and bystanders. Fifty-two buildings collapsed in Mexico City alone , Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told reporters. In all the quake killed 102 people in Mexico City and the remaining 135 from five surrounding states. Another 1,900 people were treated for injuries , the president said. The quake struck a mere 31 km ( 32 miles ) beneath the surface , sending major shockwaves through the metropolitan area of some 20 million people. Much of the capital is built upon an ancient lake bed that shakes like jelly during a quake. Initial reports suggest that collapses were limited mostly to buildings that predated the 1985 quake , after which stricter building codes were enacted. Slideshow ( 30 images ) The central part of Mexico City , in the lake bed , is always going to be a complicated place to build ,  said Rodrigo Suarez , chief operating officer at Mexico City-based apartment developer Hasta Capital. These old buildings ( may ) survive an earthquake or two or three , but since they weren  t built to modern code , there  s always going to be a risk in major earthquakes.  INTERNATIONAL AID The national electric company restored service to 95 percent of the 5 million customers who had lost power , Pena Nieto said , and the state oil monopoly Pemex said its installations suffered no significant damage and that all its operations were normal. Mexico was still recovering from another powerful tremor that killed nearly 100 people in the south of the country less than two weeks ago. Slideshow ( 30 images ) Reinforcements from other countries began to arrive and more were on the way. The United States , Israel , Spain , Japan and several Latin American countries had already responded with technical assistance and rescue teams , the president said. A Panamanian team of 32 rescue workers dressed in orange jumpsuits and helmets and two dogs arrived at Mexico City  s international airport on Wednesday , prepared to go to work immediately searching for survivors. They came self sufficient with seven days  worth of food , water and supplies and prepared to work around the clock , said Cesar Lange , leader of the Panamanian Civil Protection unit. The U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) was sending a Disaster Assistance Response Team to help , at the request of the Mexican government , the agency said. The United States remains committed to helping our neighbors during this difficult time ,  the statement said. Throughout the capital , crews were joined by volunteers and bystanders who used dogs , cameras , motion detectors and heat-seeking equipment to detect victims who may still be alive. Pena Nieto spent the day surveying several of the rescue sites , making note of the large number of university students and others have volunteered for the search and rescue effort. I have seen an active and very committed participation from the Mexican youth. ... I have seen a lot of solidarity ,  Pena Nieto said. The president has been unusually visible since the two earthquakes , a sign of the political sensitivity of disaster relief less than a year before the next presidential election. We  re clearly aware that this is a test we cannot flunk ,  said Senator Miguel Angel Chico of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI. For a graphic on earthquake location , click :"
5,"To a geologist , a rock is not just a rock , and a big crack in the ground is not what it first seems either. One such split , north of Menominee , Michigan , in the state ' s Upper Peninsula , is a large crack that formed in 2010. Not known for its earthquakes , Michigan is considered aseismic , and the Menominee Crack registered the Upper Peninsula ' s first recorded earthquake -- measured at less than magnitude 1. The feature and its causes were mysterious. Now , researchers from Michigan Technological University think they have identified what the feature is : a geological pop-up. The unusual structure is often found at the base of quarries or where glaciers have recently receded. The team , led by Wayne Pennington , dean of the College of Engineering at Michigan Tech , says the Menominee Crack is a one-of-a-kind feature as far as they can tell. "" We wanted to look into the crack because we could not find information in the literature on pop-up structures forming outside specific areas , "" Pennington says. "" As far as we can tell , this is a one-of-a-kind event ; but in case it is not , we wanted the information about it to be available for other investigators. "" The team surveyed the site and conducted seismic refraction tests to verify the crack is a pop-up structure. By capturing sound waves , Pennington ' s group confirmed the brittle limestone underlying the crack was highly fractured and bowed upwards. "" The crack itself was not as important to note as the ridge , "" Pennington says , explaining that the ridge indicated a deeper structure. He adds that pop-ups usually form where downward pressure is lessened , most commonly at quarries and glacial zones where the overlying rock or ice has been removed. "" There are no nearby quarries , however , "" Pennington says , adding that the glaciers left more than 11,000 years ago. "" There was a large tree that had been removed after it fell over and the timing certainly provides an interesting coincidence. "" He admits the cause of the crack remains a mystery -- and a puzzling one in an aseismic zone -- but it also makes the feature unique. ###|||||A long crack that popped up in a Michigan forest on Oct. 4 , 2010 , uprooted trees and caused others to tilt. A strange and sudden buckling of the earth in Michigan five years ago is now being explained as a limestone bulge , researchers reported today ( Feb. 9 ) . The upheaved rock and soil was discovered after a deep boom thundered through the forest near Birch Creek on Michigan ' s Upper Peninsula , north of Menominee. The sound shook nearby homes with the strength of a magnitude-1 earthquake on Oct. 4 , 2010 , at about 8 : 30 a.m. Central time , residents said at the time. The next day , locals discovered a long crack atop a narrow ridge. The crack was 360 feet ( 110 meters ) long and about 5 feet ( 1.7 m ) deep ; and the ridge was nearly 7 feet ( 2 m ) high and about 30 feet ( 9 m ) wide at its largest point. Tilted trees leaned away from the crack at about 14 degrees on either side  proof the ridge was new. Torn roots stretched for their former companions , now stranded on the other side of the crack. [ See Photos of the Weird Crack and Uprooted Trees ] "" It was interesting to see that the crack seemed to ignore the roots , "" said senior study author Wayne Pennington , dean of the College of Engineering at Michigan Technology University in Houghton. "" The forces were stronger than the roots. "" Based on a seismic study , the most likely explanation for the ridge is a pop-up in the upper layers of limestone beneath the clay soil , Pennington and his co-authors , all MTU students , concluded in a study published in the journal Seismological Research Letters. If I had a hammer Even though the researchers can ' t say for sure what caused the pop-up , they now have a better picture of what happened underground. The teams surveyed the underground rock by creating sound waves with a sledgehammer. The researchers slammed a sledgehammer into a metal ball sitting on the ground , and tracked how the waves passed through the soil and rock layers below. The analysis revealed a sharp buckle in the limestone below the crack. That picture suggested the bedrock limestone violently heaved upward when the pop-up appeared , displacing the overlying clay layer. The clay soil is about 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) deep along the ridge. The crack resulted from the stretching of the surface clay as it bent upward , much as a crack forms in the top of a loaf of bread as the dough rises. The survey confirms there is no earthquake fault underlying the ridge. Besides , it would take a tremendous earthquake to move the rock and soil several vertical feet , Pennington said. Pop goes the bedrock Pop-ups are common in quarries in eastern North America , where rock removal releases pent-up strain in the underlying rocks. Pop-ups also appear after glaciers retreat ; however , the last glaciers retreated from Menominee 11,000 years ago , and there is no quarrying in the area. Rocks in the area are squeezed by plate tectonics , the researchers said. The Midwest is under pressure from squeezing coming from the West Coast and the East Coast. Yet the region is not experiencing increased stress that would result in future larger earthquakes , Pennington added. The pop-up appeared in the uppermost bedrock , whereas large earthquakes strike miles deep. There have been two moderate earthquakes in Michigan since 2010 , which were in different areas and unrelated to the crack , the scientists said. One final clue was the loss , to lightning , of a giant white pine tree in the week before the crack appeared. "" The timing is remarkable , and it leads us to be suspicious , but the tree weighed less than a fully loaded dump truck , "" Pennington told Live Science.

In a tragic coincidence , one victim is the son of a deputy for the Alameda County Sheriff ' s Office , which has been tasked with removing bodies from the scene. story continues below The San Jose Mercury News reports that Derick Ion Almena , the man who created the "" Ghost Ship "" artists ' collective  and allegedly ignored warnings about fire safety  is being called "" selfish and careless "" in the wake of the disaster. He caused outrage after the fire when he failed to mention the victims in a Facebook post , lamenting instead that "" everything I worked so hard for is gone. "" Almena lived in the warehouse with his wife and children , but they were not present during the fire. Visitors and former residents describe the warehouse as a "" cluttered deathtrap "" that had been carved into many artists ' studios , with only a rickety staircase made partly of pallets connecting the second floor , where many died , with the first floor , the AP reports. Associates say Almena leased the warehouse and rented out RVs and other spaces to artists. Events like Friday ' s party were held to help raise rent money. Oakland Fire Battalion Chief Melinda Drayton warns that the search and recovery process could take a long time , CNN reports. Firefighters are removing debris "" literally bucket by bucket in a methodical , thoughtful , mindful , and compassionate way , "" she said Sunday. The fire was among the deadliest building fires in the US in the last 50 years , reports NBC News , which lists the worst 10 from that period. The Oakland fire is the seventh on a list that includes 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing. Another Mercury News story looks at how rising rents elsewhere created a thriving artistic community in Oakland ' s warehouses , which could now be forced out. "" The city ' s gonna paint us as some ugly , crusty , punk kids that are up to no good , "" says Katelyn Charvoz , 25. "" If they buy up all the warehouses on every street and kick everyone out , it will just hurt the arts community here. "" Survivor Chris Nechodom tells the San Francisco Chronicle that there were scenes of horror and panic as the fire spread from the back of the warehouse and started "" swooping down "" from the ceiling. "" We all start shuffling to the front  we ' re getting low. We get to the front and there ' s a few people yelling and screaming , so I start helping , yelling and screaming like , ' This is where the front entrance is ! Follow our boys  come here , come here ! ' "" he says. Nechodom says that before long , smoke forced him out of the building. Within minutes , he says , a "" big bellow of black smoke kind of came out of every window and it blew out of the door. "" Few survivors emerged after that , he says. The AP reports that teams including the Oakland Raiders , the Oakland A ' s , and the Golden State Warriors are donating money to help families affected by the disaster.

9,"A failed Russian spy satellite crashed back to Earth early Wednesday morning ( Oct. 20 ) , burning up in a brilliant fireball spotted by many observers in the American Midwest. The American Meteor Society ( AMS ) has so far received more than 80 reports about the fiery display , from people as far south as Tennessee and as far north as Michigan. The AMS has posted dramatic imagery captured by some of these observers , including a 27-second video from skywatcher Chris Johnson that shows the meteor blazing a trail through the skies above Fort Gratiot Township , Michigan. The fireball lit up around 12 : 43 a.m. EDT ( 0443 ) Wednesday , according to the AMS , leaving little doubt about its cause.

Staff video , USA TODAY An object described by news outlets and witnesses as a "" mysterious fireball "" briefly shot across the sky early Wednesday , raising widespread speculation about what it might have been. Residents  and experts  throughout the Midwest are weighing in with speculation. Reports of unidentified flying objects are hardly new , although some seem to be ranking what looks like a blazing ball shooting across the sky particularly high on the highly-scientific awesome scale. Interest in space  and space travel  also has been growing after private venture aerospace companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic launched successful missions. WDIV-TV , which reported the astronomical phenomenon , said the fireball was spotted locally at about 12 : 45 a.m. by sky watchers in all across Michigan. Belleville , Clinton Township , Fraser , Freeland , Holly , Howell , Pontiac , Romulus , Warren , White Lake and other communities.

10,"When the Big One hits , the first thing Washington residents notice may not be the ground shaking , but their phone issuing a warning. The U.S. Geological Survey , the University of Washington-based Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and the Washington Emergency Management Division on Tuesday , May 4 , will activate the system that sends earthquake early warnings throughout Washington state. This completes the tri-state rollout of ShakeAlert , an automated system that gives people living in Washington , Oregon and California advance warning of incoming earthquakes. For the first time , advance warning of imminent earthquake shaking will be a reality in our region. Even just seconds , up to a minute of warning is enough to prepare yourself and take cover  actions that may spare you from injury or even save your life ,  said Harold Tobin , a UW professor of Earth and space sciences and director of the PNSN , which operates the seismic monitoring in Washington and Oregon. PNSN seismic sensor work A team from the UW-based Pacific Northwest Seismic Network installs a new solar panel array at a seismic monitoring site in Enumclaw , Washington , on April 20 , 2021. The seismometer , one of hundreds that provide data for ShakeAlert , is in the hole in the foreground.

Credit : Mark Stone/University of Washington Washington ShakeAlert stations As of late April 2021 , more than 230 stations contributed to the ShakeAlert network in Washington state , with more stations going online every week. Credit : Rebecca Gourley/University of Washington Once the system goes live on May 4 , the first signs of an earthquake above a magnitude 4.5 or 5 , about when the shaking becomes noticeable indoors , will trigger an alert and a reminder to drop , cover and hold on. Warning times range from a few seconds to tens of seconds depending on your distance to the epicenter. The launch will be silent  there will be no test on May 4. The PNSN operates a growing network of about 230 seismic stations in Washington and some 155 stations in Oregon that provide data for ShakeAlert. When four or more of these instruments detect unusual shaking , that motion is analyzed by computers , some of them on the UW campus , that quickly calculate the size and location of the event. People connected to the Wireless Emergency Alert system ( the same system that produces AMBER alerts ) , will now get earthquake alerts for events of magnitude 5 or greater , using a similar interface. Alerts for events of magnitude 4.5 or above will be integrated into Android devices , where screens will also show the earthquake  s approximate magnitude and location. When people get an alert , they should use the brief warning to seek immediate protection , following this safety advice. No downloads are required  find out how to get alerts. The ShakeAlert system , similar to existing early warning systems in Mexico and Japan , began sending alerts in California in 2019 and in Oregon in March 2021. With the addition of Washington state , the system will now issue warnings to millions more people at risk from the largest possible earthquake in the lower 48 states  a rupture of the offshore Cascadia Subduction Zone , a 700-mile fault that runs from California  s Cape Mendocino to the tip of Canada  s Vancouver Island ( discovered in part through UW research ) . The alerts will also warn of potentially damaging earthquakes that are more likely to occur sooner , on one of two dozen crustal faults in the Puget Sound region alone , or deeper slips on the underlying ocean plate. The system works by detecting the first signs of an earthquake before the slower-moving but more damaging ground-shaking waves arrive. The PNSN began testing the ShakeAlert system with select Washington and Oregon businesses , utilities and organizations in 2015. Besides the individual alerts on phones , the system will be available for organizations or businesses to incorporate into their emergency plans  for instance , to close water valves , slow trains to prevent derailment , halt surgeries or pause sensitive equipment before the shaking starts. Business in the pilot program have used these alerts to close valves for water and natural gas , stop rotating equipment and alert employees. We have also partnered with Stanwood Elementary School , which has connected the system to its PA system so students can do earthquake drills that use ShakeAlert ,  said PNSN communications manager Bill Steele , who has coordinated the regional test users. Scientists at the PNSN are continuing to improve the system. About 65 % of the planned seismic stations in the network are complete in Washington state. PNSN field teams will install more seismometers through late 2025 in places like the Olympic Peninsula and Eastern Washington. The network is successfully detecting earthquakes now , but that doesn  t mean we can  t make it even better. We  re continuing to install seismometers and improve algorithms to make the alerts faster and more reliable , to give people more warning time and lower the chance of any missed events or false alarms ,  Tobin said. Initial development of the earthquake alert system by three West Coast universities , including the UW , began a decade ago and was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The buildout of the system was funded by Congress , with major grants administered by the USGS in 2015 and 2019 , and completed by federal and state agencies working with a consortium of four West Coast universities : the UW ; the University of Oregon ; the University of California , Berkeley ; and the California Institute of Technology. The Washington system also got state funding in the 2020-21 budget. Private support for Washington  s system has also come from the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust , Amazon , Puget Sound Energy and individual donors.

11,"An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 that struck in the Caribbean sea on Tuesday was felt across northern Central America , briefly prompting a tsunami warning for disaster-hit Puerto Rico and the British and US Virgin Islands. The US Tsunami Center later cancelled the alert but warned some parts of Honduras and Belize were still at risk from waves of up to a metre. The quake  which hit at 10.52pm local time  rattled windows in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa roughly 323 miles ( 519km ) to the east and was felt at least as far north as the Mexican state of Quintana Roo , but no damage was immediately reported. Rodrigo Anaya Rodriguez was in a hammock inside his house near popular tourist site Bacalar Lake on Mexico  s Caribbean coast in Quintana Roo when he felt three tremors. It felt like a bulldozer was driving past ,  he said. It didn  t last long but was very violent.  He ran to his balcony and saw electricity posts and cables swaying. In Honduras , firefighters said some residents in southern neighborhoods fled their homes after feeling the tremors. We have reports that it was felt in the majority of the country , but we don  t have reports of damage ,  said Lizandro Rosales , director of Honduras  contingencies commission. The US Geological Survey said the quake , initially reported as a magnitude 7.8 , was centered 125 miles ( 202km ) north-east of Barra Patuca in Honduras and 191 miles ( 307km ) south-west of George Town in the Cayman Islands. The quake was very shallow , at only 6.2 miles ( 10km ) , which would have amplified its effect. It was lightly felt in Belize  s former capital , Belize City , but did not prompt immediate reports of damage. Belize  s minister in charge of emergency management , Edmond Castro , spoke on local radio to urge people living in low lying coastal areas and islands to stay alert for potentially dangerous waves .|||||One of the strongest earthquakes to hit the Caribbean in modern times struck off the coast of Honduras on Tuesday night , shaking the mainland and setting off tsunami warnings that were cancelled about an hour later. There were no early reports of serious damage or casualties on land after the quake struck shortly before 10 p.m. ET. Officials in Honduras said shaking was registered across much of the nation and there were some reports of cracks in homes in Colon and Atlantida provinces along the northern coast and Olancho in eastern Honduras. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between the coast of Honduras and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday night. ( Google ) Tsunami centres issued advisories and warnings for Puerto Rico , the Cayman Islands , Cuba , Jamaica and other Caribbean islands as well as on the coasts of Mexico and Central America , cautioning that sea levels could rise from 30 centimetres to a metre above normal , but no tsunami materialized. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at a preliminary magnitude of 7.6. The tremor struck in the sea about 202 kilometres north-northeast of Barra Patuca , Honduras , and 303 kilometres southwest of George Town , Cayman Islands. The tremor occurred about 10 kilometres below the surface. Sparsely populated area The northern coast of Honduras closest to the quake ' s epicentre is sparsely populated , with much of it covered by nature reserves. The tremor was about 44 kilometres east of Honduras ' s Swan Islands , which are unpopulated except for a small navy post. Tuesday ' s quake was one of the largest to hit the Caribbean in recorded history. The 2010 quake that devastated Haiti was magnitude 7.0. CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe said given its power the quake was in "" an amazingly good spot , "" in the waters between Honduras and Cuba. "" Any closer to either country and shaking would have been much worse , "" she said ."
12,"The hospital specialised in caring for elderly people with long-term needs , as well as other patients , reported the daily JoongAng Ilbo - and reports suggest many patients would have been too ill or old to escape alone .|||||SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korean officials rushed to identify 37 victims of a hospital blaze and pinpoint the cause on Saturday as President Moon Jae-in visited the burnt-out building and decried one tragedy after another  to strike the country. Flames and toxic smoke swept through the Sejong Hospital in the southern city of Miryang on Friday , injuring more than 150 people , just weeks after a fire killed 29 people at a fitness center. All the hospital victims died from smoke inhalation. Moon visited the fire scene where he spoke to grieving family members and firefighters. Its tragic , and it hurts me to see this kind of one tragedy after another , even as the government has vowed to make this country safe ,  Moon said. He ordered a full inquiry and said utmost government efforts  were needed to support the injured and families of the victims. The government of Asia  s fourth-largest economy , with one of the world  s fastest ageing populations , has faced criticism in recent years over poor safety standards , including the Sewol ferry disaster of 2014 in which more than 300 people , mostly school children , drowned. Hospital director Song Byeong-cheol said the six-storey hospital did not have a sprinkler system and was not large enough to require one under the law. The opposition Liberal Party was quick to condemn Moon for the disaster. The Moon administration should have at least kept South Koreans safe , to justify the launch of this government ,  the party said in a statement , demanding a master plan  to protect citizens. Slideshow ( 4 images ) Moon  s ruling Democratic Party said it would embark on parliamentary discussions to legally support and protect citizens lives and safety  , a spokesman said. Ham Eun-gu , a professor at Open Cyber University of Korea , said safety checks at many private hospitals , including Sejong Hospital , were often carried out as a formality and not strictly enforced. Given that there has been a string of big fire accidents , the Moon administration won  t be able to just overlook this and let it go. ( The government ) will need to toughen fire safety regulations ,  Ham said. Last month , 29 people were killed in a blaze at an eight-storey fitness center in Jecheon City , most of them women trapped in a sauna. That disaster fueled anger over reports of shoddy construction , among other shortcomings. In 2014 , a fire at a rural hospital killed 21 people , while a 2008 warehouse fire outside Seoul killed 40. Many survivors of Friday  s blaze walked though fire and smoke  to escape , a city official told Reuters on Friday. Those on upper floors used fire engine ladders and plastic escape slides , while firefighters carried some who could not walk. I saw elderly patients scrambling out through the windows and had to help ,  said Woo Young-min , 25 , as he stood in his pyjamas outside the hospital. Slideshow ( 4 images ) The fire broke out at the rear of the emergency room on the hospital  s first floor , fire official Choi Man-woo told reporters. Television broadcast images of black smoke billowing from the windows and entrance. At least 177 patients , most of them elderly , were in the hospital and a nursing home next door when the fire broke out , hospital director Song told reporters. Song said three of the nine hospital staff on duty at the time died - at least one doctor , a nurse and a nurse  s aide. Most of those who died were on the first and second floors , said Choi ."

14,"Only a handful of ancient Mayan temples rise above a dense jungle of trees in Guatemala. But what ' s obscured by the thick foliage , revealed for the first time , is evidence of a sprawling civilization to rival ancient Greece or China. Using LiDAR technology ( Light Detection And Ranging ) , which measures wavelengths from laser pulses aimed at the ground , scientists digitally removed the jungle to reveal more than 60,000 previously unknown Mayan structures like palaces , fortifications , farms , irrigation systems , and raised highways connecting nearly all ancient cities across 800 square miles in northern Guatemala , report Live Science and National Geographic. "" We ' ll need 100 years to go through all [ the data ] and really understand what we ' re seeing , "" says researcher Francisco Estrada-Belli. But already it ' s apparent that the civilization has been "" grossly underestimated , "" says archaeologist Thomas Garrison. story continues below The new data show a civilization twice the size of medieval England at its peak 1,200 years ago. And though population estimates previously hovered around 5 million , expansive irrigation and terracing systems and wide highways indicate there might ' ve been "" 10 to 15 million people there  including many living in low-lying , swampy areas that many of us had thought uninhabitable , "" Estrada-Belli says. Walls , fortresses , and ramparts also suggest war was "" large-scale and systematic "" and "" endured over many years "" not just "" toward the end of the civilization , "" says Garrison. One of the coolest discoveries , however , was a 100-foot pyramid in the heart of the city of Tikal , which was previously assumed to be a small mountain , reports Reuters. More discoveries are likely to be made as scientists plan to map 5,000 square miles of Guatemala ' s lowlands during the ongoing project. ( The Maya parried one collapse before the fatal blow. )|||||Earlier this year , a team of archaeologists announced the discovery of more than 61,000 long-lost Maya roads , fortresses , drainage canals , and buildings hidden beneath the dense green canopy of northern Guatemala  s tropical forest. The findings were the result of an airborne laser , or lidar , survey of 2,144 square kilometers of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. Now , archaeologists are starting to piece together what all the data actually says about Maya civilization. The picture emerging from beneath the jungle canopy is of a much more complex political and economic landscape than we previously realized. In February , you were really getting our first impressions as we began exploring the data , which was filmed by National Geographic. The Science article is about putting actual numbers behind those first impressions ,  Ithaca College archaeologist Tom Garrison told Ars Technica. A network of cities Garrison , with archaeologists Marcello Canuto and Francisco Estrada-Belli of Tulane University and colleagues , used the lidar survey data to estimate that a Mayan population of between 7 million and 11 million people lived in the central Maya Lowlands ( parts of the Yucatan , Guatemala , and Belize ) in the bustling Late Classic Period between 650 and 800 CE. With 29 structures per square kilometer in the survey area , and evidence from earlier excavations to suggest how many of those structures might have been houses , the team calculated an average of 80 to 120 people per square kilometer. The overall number lines up well with estimates from previous studies , even though it was derived independently. What archaeologists haven  t known for sure , because of the small-scale nature of most excavations so far , is how all those people clustered among the rolling karst and seasonal wetlands of northern Guatemala. With the large scale of the new survey , however , archaeologists can see a network of densely populated cities , connected by invisible bonds of trade and political affiliation that appear on the landscape as elevated roads between settlements. That image supports the view that researchers have collectively leaned toward in recent years : the Maya were not a scattering of isolated , warring city-states living off slash-and-burn farms. They built urban centers supported by intensive farming of drained and irrigated lowland fields and carefully constructed upland terraces. The largest cities seem to be surrounded by smaller satellite cities and patches of rural territory , which Canuto and his colleagues say were probably connected politically and economically. Maya breadbasket ? To support so many large cities , the Maya would have had to modify the landscape in more drastic ways than just clearing some trees ; irrigating fields or draining wetlands would be essential. The fact that archaeologists have been estimating a population in that range for several years suggested that the Maya probably practiced more intensive farming , but archaeologists didn  t have enough data to say how widespread it was. Advertisement But in the lidar images , the ghostly outlines of channels reveal grids across the low seasonal wetlands , called bajos , where they would have served as a combination of irrigation channels and flood control. Most are one or two meters wide , between 20 and 50cm deep , and the longest stretch for a kilometer across the low-lying fields. In the uplands , lidar images revealed the long outlines of terraces and low field walls. All told , about 17 percent of the survey area seems to have been farmland. But that varied from less than one percent in some blocks to as much as 70 percent around large cities like Tikal. Even with so much land under cultivation , and even with a lot of labor and infrastructure invested in getting the most out of the land , however , some of the larger Maya cities would have needed to rely on imported food to feed their people. Canuto et al. 2018 Canuto et al. 2018 Canuto et al. 2018 Canuto et al. 2018 Trade and transport It is clear that some of the most densely settled cities , like Naachtun and Tikal , would not have been able to support their population with the land available to them ,  Garrison told Ars Technica. Other kingdoms , like Holmul , definitely had surplus. I suspect that yes , there was a certain degree of exchange of staple foods.  Further lidar surveys may help shed light on agricultural systems and which kingdoms controlled which chunks of farmland. There ' s evidence of formal links between cities during earlier periods in Maya history in the form of elevated roads called causeways. These link many large cities with the smaller urban centers nearby ; in a few cases , they link major cities to each other. These are broad roads , 10 or 20 meters wide , and the longest runs 22km through what was once farmland. But most of the causeways that show up on the survey link cities that rose to prominence between 1000 BCE and 250 CE. Because archaeological evidence suggests that most Preclassic ( 1000 to 250 BCE ) cities were abandoned by the Late Classic Period , Garrison says the causeways between them probably also fell into disuse. Sometimes that abandonment stood out in stark relief in the lidar images. In one interesting case from the lidar , agricultural terraces associated with the Classic-period kingdom of Xultun are constructed over a Preclassic causeway that had emanated out of the nearby site of San Bartolo ,  he told Ars Technica. In this case , the lidar is literally revealing the layering of settlement over time.  Fortresses to withstand a siege What the Maya were building during the Late Classic Period , however , were fortifications  and lots of them. Defensive systems of bridges , ditches , ramparts , and stone walls lie hidden beneath the foliage in greater numbers and at greater scale than Canuto and his colleagues expected , even though texts and archaeological evidence both portray the Maya as a militaristic , conflict-prone people. Advertisement Their own writing gives sometimes vivid descriptions of war , in one case using hurricanes as a metaphor for the fury of battle , and in another describing its aftermath as the piling of skulls and the pooling of blood ,   Garrison told Ars Technica. And archaeological work at Tikal and a few strategic points farther west has revealed some earthworks. The defensive structures that showed up on the lidar survey , however , were much more common , and much more sophisticated , than most archaeologists had expected. And that suggests that Maya civilization must , at least at times , have engaged in warfare on an even larger scale than anyone thought. As evidence , Garrison points to a fortress revealed by the lidar survey , perched on the edge of an escarpment between Tikal and the nearby city kingdom of El Zotz. The citadel is protected by walls that are over 25 feet tall , and there is a large artificial reservoir that looks like an Olympic swimming pool. In other words , this place ( named La Cuernavilla ) was ready for a siege ,  he told Ars Technica. That is not really the type of conflict that we think about for the ancient Maya.  Garrison is about to begin a three-year excavation at La Cuernavilla. Lasers in the air and boots on the ground Many of the features that showed up in the lidar images are much harder to spot from the ground. Causeways , irrigation channels , and small defensive earthworks often leave a pretty subtle mark on the landscape after a few centuries , and their scale extends well beyond a person  s field of view in the dense jungle. Even knowing a causeway is there and having lidar imagery loaded into my GPS , I still need to search carefully to be sure that I am in fact recognizing its edges ,  Garrison told Ars Technica. But there are still years  worth of work to be done on the ground to confirm that what Canuto  s team saw in the digital images is actually there beneath the tropical forest canopy , a process archaeologists call ground-truthing. That process began before the survey even started ; by choosing survey areas with known archaeological sites , the team could use those sites to help calibrate what they saw in the images. And more ground-truthing fieldwork started in 2017 , shortly after the completion of the survey flights. In general , the lidar is extremely accurate , missing only the most subtle structures. There are occasional false identifications , but that seems to be restricted to certain types of terrain ,  Garrison told Ars Technica. Meanwhile , the survey has revealed some new sites for archaeology , such as Garrison  s upcoming work at La Cuernavilla , and provided a broader context for sites that have been excavated for years. And the broad view of the Maya landscape still leaves plenty of questions unanswered ; there  s lots of detail to fill in on the big picture , and that detail may shape how archaeologists eventually interpret what they see in the lidar images. And more large-scale views of the ancient landscape may be forthcoming , since the 2016 survey covered only portions of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. The Foundation for Maya Cultural and National Heritage , or Pacunam , has plans to cover most of the rest of the reserve in the coming years. Science , 2018.

15,"High school students in an Alaska district will no longer discuss several literary classics in class. The Matanuska-Susitna School Board voted 5-2 last week to remove five titles from the list of books teachers can use in elective English classes , the Anchorage Daily News reports. The books stricken are : Invisible Man , by Ralph Ellison ; Catch-22 , by Joseph Heller ; The Things They Carried , by Tim O  Brien ; I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , by Maya Angelou ; and The Great Gatsby , by F. Scott Fitzgerald. There was no public comment at the meeting. The objections involve depictions of rape and incest  things that are pretty serious problems , especially in our teenage world , "" one school board member said. Another member who voted "" yes "" said he read a summary of Angelou ' s book , which had a description of molestation. "" If I were to read this in a professional environment at my office , I would be dragged to the equal opportunity office , "" he said. story continues below A district spokeswoman didn ' t know whether the books will be pulled from school libraries. But the vote sparked a run on the titles at a bookstore in Palmer , per KTUU. Fireside Books ran out of all five titles in hours. "" We were getting five or six [ calls ] an hour , "" the owner said. Another business owner in town announced a contest to reward students who could demonstrate that they ' d read all five books. DanaLyn Dalrymple planned to draw five names and present each winner with $ 100. But she had to rework that after the pot grew. "" Within 24 hours , I had about 50 people who were willing to make a donation for a prize , "" she said. The bookstore is working with her to get the books to every student who wants to enter the contest. "" We ' re going to get as many kids a prize as we can , "" Dalrymple said.

The Matanuska-Susitna borough school board in Palmer , Alaska , which oversees 46 schools , voted last week to remove five books from its curriculum for high-school English : F Scott Fitzgerald  s The Great Gatsby , Maya Angelou  s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Joseph Heller  s Catch-22 , Ralph Ellison  s Invisible Man , and short-story collection The Things They Carried by Tim O  Brien. According to local paper the Frontiersman News , five members voted in favour of the removal , and two voted against. The books remain in school libraries , but will no longer be taught. According to a flier from the district  s Office of Instruction , Angelou  s memoir had been challenged over its sexually explicit material , such as the sexual abuse the author suffered as a child , and its anti-white  messaging  , while Fitzgerald  s classic novel was pulled for language and sexual references  . Invisible Man was marked for containing language , rape and incest  , while Catch-22 was included for its violence , a handful of racial slurs  and the fact the characters speak with typical military men  misogyny and racist attitudes of the time  . But locals have protested the removal by promoting the books far and wide. Bookstore Fireside Books has been raising funds to get the books out to young readers locally , a digital book club has been set up to discuss the titles , the Mat-Su Valley Banned Book Challenge is offering a $ 100 prize to those students who read all five titles , and local food truck DallyMac &amp; Cheese will give a free mac  n  cheese to students who present a one-page report on any of the books. By providing these books to MatSu Borough students , we aim to : broaden horizons , foster critical thinking , encourage healthy debate and discussion , nurture empathy and understanding , advocate engagement in social issues , enable independent thought [ and ] challenge censorship ,  wrote Fireside Books on Facebook , adding that many concerned individuals from far and wide  had donated money to pay for books to be distributed to children. There  s been a huge response from the community ,  Mary Ann Cockle , owner of the store , told CNN. The outpouring of support and concern about banning and censorship has been quite a surprise  but in a good way.  The board was criticised by Palmer city council member Sabrena Combs , who told CNN that describing the topics covered by the books as too harsh or too scary  was absurd , because then you end up with kids that graduate and have no idea what any experience outside of their own could possibly be  . She also slammed the timing of the meeting , which was livestreamed because of the coronavirus pandemic , saying the board had tried to slip it under the radar  . Jeff Taylor , one of the board members to vote for the books to be removed , stressed on Facebook that the books had not been banned , rather removed from the approved reading list. But he said that Covid-19 had made public interaction around the issue difficult , and acknowledged that the livestream did not facilitate a quick public response  . Taylor , who admitted to only having read The Great Gatsby from the selection of five books , said he wanted to give parents more freedom , control , and involvement in determining what their children read  . I have no doubt that these books will be read more in the near future than they have been in the recent past. There are even rewards being offered , by private entities , for those who read them ,  he wrote. I applaud those who choose to read these books on their own accord. I applaud parents and caregivers who are involved in their student  s education. I applaud teachers who truly want to help students learn. If these are books that interest you , by all means , buy them , check them out , talk with people about them. That is the beauty of freedom . "
16,"Tsunamis can occur far from the ocean , and climate change is increasing the risk of disaster in one of the more unlikely places on Earth : the Himalayas. Lakes are forming more frequently in the area thanks to glacial melting , and when a natural dam breaks  due to erosion , water pressure , or earthquakes  the result is known as a glacial-lake outburst. At least 50 outbursts have occurred in the past century , and the risk of a tsunami is increasing with their frequency , Time reports. story continues below In eastern Nepal ' s Dudh Koshi region , for instance , most glaciers are retreating at between 30 and 200 feet each year , says an expert , while others are going as fast as 240 feet per year.

Photo by Willyam Bradberry/Shutterstock Jan. 25 ( UPI ) -- New research suggests acoustic-gravity waves , or AGWs , could be used as a defense against deadly tsunamis. Acoustic-gravity waves are sound waves that can travel for several miles beneath the surface of the ocean. Tsunamis are massive waves produced by earthquakes , landslides or other major geological phenomena. Advertisement Scientists at Cardiff University theorized the power of acoustic-gravity waves could be harnessed and directed at an oncoming tsunami wave , reducing its amplitude and thus diminishing the magnitude of the damage. Researchers described the strategy in the journal Heliyon. A single blast of AGWs , which can stretch several thousand feet , could shorten the height of a wave and spread its power out over a greater area. A series of AGWs fired in succession could dissipate the wave ' s power and momentum entirely. "" Within the last two decades , tsunamis have been responsible for the loss of almost half a million lives , widespread long-lasting destruction , profound environmental effects and global financial crisis , "" Usama Kadri , a researcher at Cardiff University ' s School of Mathematics , said in a news release. "" Up until now , little attention has been paid to trying to mitigate tsunamis and the potential of acoustic-gravity waves remains largely unexplored. "" Advertisement The next step in the battle against tsunamis is developing some sort of underwater cannon -- or modulator -- capable of generating AGW frequency blasts. Natural AGWs are generated in the ocean by geological events ; researchers suggest these AGWs could be redirected toward a threatening tsunami. Tests show AGW detectors can predict the approach of a tsunami. The next step is to turn those sound waves against the seismic sea wave. RELATED Active plate boundary explains earthquake risk in Southern Italy "" In practice , generating the appropriate acoustic-gravity waves introduces serious challenges due to the high energy required for an effective interaction with a tsunami , "" said Kadri. "" However , this study has provided proof-of-concept that devastating tsunamis could be mitigated by using acoustic-gravity waves to redistribute the huge amounts of energy stored within the wave , potentially saving lives and billions of pounds worth of damage . ""|||||Indian Ocean ( Jan. 2 , 2005 ) . A village near the coast of Sumatra lays in ruin after the Tsunami that struck South East Asia. Image : Wikipedia Devastating tsunamis could be halted before hitting the Earth ' s shoreline by firing deep-ocean sound waves at the oncoming mass of water , new research has proposed. Dr Usama Kadri , from Cardiff University ' s School of Mathematics , believes that lives could ultimately be saved by using acoustic-gravity waves ( AGWs ) against tsunamis that are triggered by earthquakes , landslides and other violent geological events. AGWs are naturally occurring sounds waves that move through the deep ocean at the speed of sound and can travel thousands of metres below the surface. AGWs can measure tens or even hundreds of kilometres in length and it is thought that certain lifeforms such as plankton , that are unable to swim against a current , rely on the waves to aid their movement , enhancing their ability to find food. In a paper published today in the journal Heliyon , Dr Kadri proposes that if we can find a way to engineer these waves , they can be fired at an incoming tsunami and will react with the wave in such a way that reduces its amplitude , or height , and causes its energy to be dissipated over a large area. By the time the tsunami reaches the shoreline , Dr Kadri writes , the reduced height of the tsunami would minimise the damage caused to both civilians and the environment. Dr Kadri also believes that this process of firing AGWs at a tsunami could be repeated continuously until the tsunami is completely dispersed. "" Within the last two decades , tsunamis have been responsible for the loss of almost half a million lives , widespread long-lasting destruction , profound environmental effects and global financial crisis , "" Dr Kadri said. "" Up until now , little attention has been paid to trying to mitigate tsunamis and the potential of acoustic-gravity waves remains largely unexplored. "" The devastating tsunami that was generated in the Indian Ocean in 2004 after a magnitude 9 earthquake has been recorded as one of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history after it caused over 230,000 deaths in 14 countries. The energy released on the Earth ' s surface by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami was estimated to be the equivalent of over 1,500 times that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. In order to use AGWs in tsunami mitigation , engineers will firstly need to devise highly accurate AGW frequency transmitters or modulators , which Dr Kadri concedes would be challenging. It may also be possible to utilise the AGWs that are naturally generated in the ocean when a violent geological event , such as an earthquake , occurs  essentially using nature ' s natural processes against itself. Indeed , Dr Kadri has already shown that naturally occurring AGWs could be utilised in an early tsunami detection system by placing detection systems in the deep ocean. Dr Kadri continued : "" In practice , generating the appropriate acoustic-gravity waves introduces serious challenges due to the high energy required for an effective interaction with a tsunami. However , this study has provided proof-of-concept that devastating tsunamis could be mitigated by using acoustic-gravity waves to redistribute the huge amounts of energy stored within the wave , potentially saving lives and billions of pounds worth of damage.

17,"Mount Fuji , or Fujisan as it is known in Japanese , is the highest point on the archipelago ( rising to 3,776 metres ) and the national emblem , immortalised in countless etchings. In June last year Unesco added it to the World Heritage list as a "" sacred place and source of artistic inspiration "" . But it is still an active volcano , standing at the junction between the Pacific , Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates. Though it has rarely stirred in recorded history , it is still potentially explosive. The Tohoku  or Great East Japan  earthquake on 11 March 2011 triggered a devastating tsunami , which in turn caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. According to a Franco-Japanese study published by Science ( PDF ) , the magnitude-9 tremor also increased the pressure on Mount Fuji. "" Our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting , but it does show that it ' s in a critical state , "" says Florent Brenguier , a researcher at the Institute of Earth Sciences ( IST ) in Grenoble , France , and lead author of the publication , to which the Institute of Global Physics ( IPG ) in Paris also contributed. Adopting a novel approach , the scientists carried out a sort of giant echo-scan of the bowels of the Earth , based on the huge mass of data recorded after the mega-quake by Japan ' s Hi-net system , the densest network in the world , with 800 seismic sensors. They focused on signals commonly known as seismic noise , the result of constant interaction between ocean swell and "" solid "" earth. In the past such data has generally been dismissed as background interference. By recording fluctuations in this barely perceptible subterranean noise they were able to map geological disturbances in the bedrock of Japan caused by the seismic waves following the violent quake in March 2011. "" Seismic waves travel a very long way , going round the world several times , "" Brenguier explains. "" Their movement makes the Earth ' s crust vibrate , and rather like a shock wave this produces breaks or cracks in the rock. "" A snow-capped Mount Fuji. A Franco-Japanese study of seismic data suggests pressure is building for a new eruption. Photograph : The Asahi Shimbun/Getty One might well imagine that such disturbance is greatest close to the epicentre of a quake , but this is not the case. The Franco-Japanese study shows that the area where the Earth ' s crust suffered the greatest damage was not around Tohoku , in the north-east of Honshu island , but in the volcanic regions , in particular under Mount Fuji , some 400km away. "" The volcanic regions are the ones where the fluids trapped in the rock  boiling water , gas , liquid magma , which cause an eruption when they rise to the surface  exert the greatest pressure. The seismic waves add to this pressure , causing even more disturbance , "" Brenguier says. The magnitude 6.4 quake that occurred four days after the tsunami , followed by many smaller aftershocks , was a further indication that Mount Fuji is under high pressure. So should Japan be on red alert ? "" We cannot establish a direct relation of cause and effect between quakes and volcanic eruptions , even if statistically the former lead to an increase in the latter , "" Brenguier says. "" All we can say is that Mount Fuji is now in a state of pressure , which means it displays a high potential for eruption. The risk is clearly higher. "" Science , however , has no way of predicting when this might happen. But there is a precedent. The last eruption of Mount Fuji occurred in 1707. It projected almost a billion cubic metres of ash and debris into the atmosphere , some of which reached Tokyo ( then called Edo ) 100km away. It was preceded , 49 days earlier , by a magnitude 8.7 quake to the south of Japan that , in conjunction with the tidal wave it raised , claimed more than 5,000 lives. This time , more than three years have already passed since the Tohoku quake. But that does not mean that Mount Fuji , under the constant supervision of Japanese geologists , is slumbering. Come what may , the method developed by the Franco-Japanese team for investigating volcanic areas should improve the accuracy of efforts all over the world to assess the risk of major volcanic eruptions.

19,"SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea said on Saturday that North Korea  s nuclear capability is expanding fast , echoing alarm around the world over the isolated state  s fifth and biggest nuclear test , carried out in defiance of U.N. sanctions. North Korea conducted the test on Friday and said it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile , ratcheting up a threat that rivals and the United Nations have been powerless to contain. The test showed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was unwilling to alter course , and that tougher sanctions and pressure were needed to apply unbearable pain on the North to leave no choice but to change  , South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said. North Korea  s nuclear capability is growing and speeding to a considerable level , considering the fifth nuclear test was the strongest in scale and the interval has quickened substantially ,  Yun told a ministry meeting convened to discuss the test. The blast , on the 68th anniversary of North Korea  s founding , drew global condemnation. The United States said it would work with partners to impose new sanctions , and called on China to use its influence - as North Korea  s main ally - to pressure Pyongyang to end its nuclear program. In Beijing on Saturday , Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui told North Korea  s ambassador to China , Ji Jae Ryong , that the test was not conducive to the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula  , China  s Foreign Ministry said. China urges North Korea not to take any more actions that could exacerbate tensions , and return as soon as possible to the correct direction of denuclearisation ,  Zhang said. But Russia was skeptical that more sanctions were the answer , while China was silent on the prospect of a new U.N. Security Council resolution , although state media did carry commentaries criticizing the North. Under 32-year-old leader Kim , North Korea has sped up development of its nuclear and missile programs , despite U.N. sanctions that were tightened in March and have further isolated the impoverished country. DENUNCIATION The Security Council denounced North Korea  s decision to carry out the test and said it would begin work immediately on a resolution. The United States , Britain and France pushed for the 15-member body to impose new sanctions. U.S. President Barack Obama said after speaking by telephone with South Korean President Park Geun-hye and with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday that they had agreed to work with the Security Council and other powers to vigorously enforce existing measures and to take additional significant steps , including new sanctions  . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it may take more than additional sanctions to resolve the crisis , suggesting that a Security Council agreement may prove difficult. It is too early to bury the six-party talks. We should look for ways that would allow us to resume them ,  Lavrov said. The talks , aimed at ending the North  s nuclear program , involve the United States , Russia , Japan , South Korea , China , and North Korea , but have been defunct since 2008. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had repeatedly offered talks to North Korea , but Pyongyang had to accept de-nuclearization , which it had refused to do. Slideshow ( 25 images ) We have made overture after overture to the dictator of North Korea ,  he said , adding that he ultimately hoped for an outcome similar to that reached in nuclear talks with Iran. China said it was resolutely opposed to the test but Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying would not be drawn on whether China would support tougher sanctions. On Saturday , the Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said North Korea was wrong in thinking that building nuclear weapons would provide it with more security or prestige. Owning nuclear weapons won  t ensure North Korea  s political security ,  it said in an editorial. On the contrary , it is poison that is slowly suffocating the country.  Slideshow ( 25 images ) OUT OF CONTROL  South Korea  s Park said late on Friday that Kim was mentally out of control  , blind to all warnings from the world and neighbors as he sought to maintain power. The patience of the international community has come to the limit ,  she said. North Korea , which calls the South and the United States its main enemies , said its scientists and technicians carried out a nuclear explosion test for the judgment of the power of a nuclear warhead  , according to its official KCNA news agency. It said the test proved North Korea was capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a medium-range ballistic missile , which it last tested on Monday when Obama and other world leaders were gathered in China for a G20 summit. Pyongyang  s claims of being able to miniaturize a nuclear warhead have never been independently verified. Its continued testing in defiance of sanctions presents a challenge to Obama in the final months of his presidency and could become a factor in the U.S. presidential election in November , and a headache to be inherited by whoever wins. North Korea has been testing different types of missiles at an unprecedented rate this year , and the capability to mount a nuclear warhead would be especially worrisome for its neighbors South Korea and Japan. The Pentagon does not have evidence that North Korea had been able to miniaturize a nuclear weapon , Pentagon spokesman Gary Ross said. But he added : Given the consequences of getting it wrong , it is prudent for a military planner to plan for the worst.  Jeffrey Lewis of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies said the highest estimates of seismic magnitude suggested this was North Korea  s most powerful nuclear test so far , at yield of 20 to 30 kilotonnes. That would make this test larger than the nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in World War Two , which had an output of about 15 kilotonnes. South Korea  s military put the force of the blast at 10 kilotonnes , which would still be the North  s most powerful blast to date. The important thing is that , five tests in , they now have a lot of nuclear test experience. They aren  t a backward state any more ,  Lewis said .|||||A tense 2016 lies ahead on the Korean Peninsula after a North Korean nuclear test that could mark an alarming leap forward in the country ' s technology. Pyongyang claims that it successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb for the first time , though experts say the Wednesday morning explosion  believed to have caused a 5.1-magnitude quake  was closer in size to North Korea ' s three previous nuclear tests than to a hydrogen bomb explosion , reports the Washington Post. Kim Jong Un claimed last month that the country had an H-bomb , a weapon much more powerful and harder to make than an atomic bomb , and a confirmed test would almost certainly lead to tough new sanctions against North Korea , the AP reports. story continues below North Korean state media reported that the test of the "" miniaturized "" H-bomb was a "" perfect success.

20,"Nepal has ordered a review of the way summit helicopter rescues are conducted after uncovering a multimillion-dollar scam in which climbers were pressured , sometimes by having their food spiked , to take costly flights down mountains. Insurance industry figures said the scam , which had been operating for more than five years , had caused at least one unnecessary death and involved dozens of helicopter companies , tour operators , hotels and hospitals. Thousands of climbers had been forced to abandon their ascents at the first sign of illness and take expensive helicopter rides to private hospitals , according to an investigation by the Nepalese government. Their bills were allegedly charged to insurance companies , with kickbacks given to the trekking guides , hotels and sometimes the climbers themselves. One investigation on behalf of insurers estimated there had been more than 1,600 helicopter rescues so far this year , of which about 35 % had been fraudulent , costing the companies more than $ 4m (  3.1m ) . Several international insurers warned that they would pull out of Nepal by 1 September if the government did not act. On Sunday , the tourism ministry issued new directives ordering helicopter companies , trekking operators and hospitals to submit every rescue invoice to a new government committee within 10 days of the bill being issued. Unspecified legal action was also proposed against 15 Nepalese companies accused of unnecessary evacuations or hospitalisations , with more to be investigated in coming months , according to sources monitoring the inquiry. He became quite aggressive  Danny Kaine was nearing the halfway mark of his five-day trek to Everest base camp in June when he told his guide he had a headache. Instantly he said , we need a helicopter , we need to get you out ,  the experienced British trekker said. He became quite aggressive.  Kaine was flown to a private hospital in Kathmandu where he underwent a series of tests. My final bill was $ 12,800  for a headache ,  he said. I could  ve taken two Advil and it would  ve been fine.  Unbeknown to the trekking company , Kaine had been hired by three insurers to investigate why 2017 had been the most expensive year on record for the companies. He said the growing popularity of climbing Nepal  s famous peaks and the allure of Mount Everest had led to a proliferation of trekking companies offering climbs at heavily discounted rates. The majority of the trekking companies involved in the fraud are charging a lot less than legitimate companies , maybe $ 500 for a $ 1,000 trek ,  said Kaine , who works for the medical assistance company Traveller Assist. They are losing money on each trek and need to make it up.  Kaine said he had uncovered examples of budget-conscious travellers paying $ 500 to trek to Everest base camp and upon arriving , being offered $ 750 by trekking companies to feign illness and be evacuated by helicopter. The heli company would pay the trekking company $ 2,000 in commission , which they make back from the hospital that pays them a commission to bring them foreign patients , who they then over-treat and over-bill the insurer for ,  he said. There  s money at every level of this.  An investigation by the Nepalese government starting in June found evidence that guides were putting baking soda in food given to tourists , causing diarrhoea and creating an excuse to fly them off the mountain. We  ve heard of cases where tourists have been made deliberately ill ,  Prakash Sharma Dhakal , the official who led the inquiry , told Agence France-Presse earlier this month. In our investigation , we  ve seen a profit margin of up to 63 % by some companies  and hospitals have issued bills of up to 6m rupees (  40,700 ) .  Instagram plays a huge part in this  Tim Riley , the managing director of the insurance company True Traveller , said the problem had emerged as rescue companies started investing in helicopters around 2010. They need to get their money back ,  he said. His company also covers tourists climbing Mount Kilimanjaro , the highest peak in Africa , from which it has paid for one helicopter rescue in eight years. We  ve covered about 40 in Nepal last year , and even that  s massively down on the past ,  he said. In 2013 we had six in one weekend.  Kaine said the scam was a symptom of the growing popularity of climbing holidays in Nepal , fuelled in part by social media posts that showed off the beauty of the summits and made them seem accessible. Five or ten years ago , people didn  t think Nepal or Everest were possible ,  he said. Instagram plays a huge part in this. Year on year , there  s between 20-30 % more travel insurance sold for Nepal in the past five years.  A record 373 permits were issued to foreigners to climb Everest from the Nepal side in 2017 , leading to warnings the mountain was becoming dangerously overcrowded. Veteran mountaineers have complained that budget companies have flooded the market in the past decade , attracting inexperienced climbers and cutting costs on safety and equipment .|||||For exclusive access to all of our fitness , gear , adventure , and travel stories , plus discounts on trips , events , and gear , sign up for Outside+ today and save 20 percent . In Nepal , there  s a new scam directed at trekkers in the Mount Everest region , and to see how it works you need look no further than the experience of Jessica Reeves. The Australian told Agence France-Presse that she was trekking with Himalayan Social Journey when she complained to her guide about a common cold. It wasn ' t an emergency , and certainly not life threatening. But her guide repeatedly urged her to agree to a helicopter rescue. They said if I kept going it would be really risky , so it was better to leave now instead of risking it ,  she said. According to Reeves , nine or ten hikers in her group shared a helicopter ride back to a hospital in Kathmandu , but were each told to say they were alone. She thinks that Himalayan Social Journey billed each of the client  s insurance providers for a separate helicopter ride , banking about $ 35,000 in the process. Another trekker told GearJunkie earlier this month that her partner complained of a mild headache and their guide suggested a helicopter rescue right away , saying they should both take the ride and tell whoever asked that they were feeling very sick. A local helicopter pilot , who rescued trekkers almost daily during the April and May trekking season , told AFP that during that time he flew only three people who actually seemed to be ill. One of the more concerning findings was of companies serving food tainted with baking soda , a known laxative , in order to sicken tourists so they could be pressured into a helicopter rescue. As the scam goes , once off the mountain the climbers are taken to hospitals , where they undergo a battery of tests , all billed to their insurance. From mountain to hospital and back , the guides , helicopter companies , and hospitals all take a cut from these false insurance claims. According to AFP and Traveller Assist , a UK-based company that represents international insurers , the high number of helicopter rescues for tourists made 2017 the most expensive year yet in Nepal for insurance companies ( though 2018 is on track to outdo it ) . Outrage over this widespread scheme prompted a major government crackdown this summer. And last month an investigative committee submitted a 700-page report to Nepalese Tourism Minister Rabindra Adhikari. The report found that 1,300 helicopter rescues took place in the first five months of 2016 and cost insurers more $ 6.5 million. One of the more concerning findings detailed how some guides served food tainted with baking soda , a known laxative , in order to sicken tourists so they could be pressured into a helicopter rescue. In all , according to the Kathmandu Post , the investigation probed ten helicopter companies , six hospitals , and 36 travel , trekking , and rescue agencies  with further investigation of 15 of these companies recommended. The scamming has become so pervasive that the report advised that all rescue operations be taken over by Nepal  s police. The stakes for solving the problem are high. Insurance companies set a September 1 deadline for Nepal to crack down on the abuse , threatening to stop providing coverage for trekkers and climbers if nothing is done. That would have huge ramifications on the country and the people who depend on this work , because tourism is one of Nepal  s main industries. The country already took a major financial hit after the 2015 magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck. It killed nearly 9,000 people and crumbled homes and buildings. Ever since , tourism has been slow to recover. Meanwhile , there are more than 2,600 trekking agencies competing for this now smaller pool of tourists. So operators lower their rates , which leaves little money left over. We are moving on a price war rather than a service war.  Deepak Joshi , CEO of the Nepal Tourism Board , told GearJunkie. And that is causing desperate measures . "
21,"Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in an attack on his private residence , the country  s interim prime minister said in a statement Wednesday , calling it a hateful , inhumane , and barbaric act. "" First Lady Martine Moise was hospitalized following the overnight attack , interim Premier Claude Joseph said. The nation of more than 11 million people had grown increasingly unstable and disgruntled under Moise , the AP reports. "" The country  s security situation is under the control of the National Police of Haiti and the Armed Forces of Haiti , "" Joseph said in a statement from his office. "" Democracy and the republic will win. "" Joseph said police have been deployed to the National Palace and the upscale community of Ptionville and will be sent to other areas. He said some of the attackers spoke in Spanish but offered no further explanation. story continues below Moise , who was 53 , had been ruling by decree for more than two years after the country failed to hold elections , which led to Parliament being dissolved. Opposition leaders have accused him of seeking to increase his power , including approving a decree that limited the powers of a court that audits government contracts and another that created an intelligence agency that answers only to the president. In recent months , opposition leaders demanded the he step down , arguing that his term legally ended in February 2021. Moise and supporters maintained that his term began when he took office in early 2017 , following a chaotic election that forced the appointment of a provisional president to serve during a year-long gap. Haiti was scheduled to hold general elections later this year.

The police had killed four of the "" mercenaries "" and captured two more , Police General Director Leon Charles said in televised comments late on Wednesday , adding that security forces would not rest until they had all been dealt with. "" We blocked them en route as they left the scene of the crime , "" he said. "" Since then , we have been battling with them. "" "" They will be killed or apprehended. "" Moise , a 53-year-old former businessman who took office in 2017 , was shot dead and his wife , Martine Moise , was seriously wounded when heavily armed assassins stormed the couple ' s home in the hills above Port-au-Prince at around 1 a.m. local time ( 0500 GMT ) . Haiti ' s ambassador to the United States , Bocchit Edmond , told Reuters in an interview the gunmen were masquerading as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) agents as they entered Moise ' s guarded residence under cover of nightfall - a move that would likely have helped them gain entry. The brazen assassination , which drew condemnation from the U.N. Security Council , the United States and neighboring Latin American countries , came amid political unrest , a surge in gang violence , and a growing humanitarian crisis in the poorest nation in the Americas. The government declared a two-week state of emergency to help it hunt down the assassins , whom Edmond described as a group of "" foreign mercenaries "" and well-trained killers. The gunmen spoke English and Spanish , said interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph , who assumed the leadership of the country , where the majority speak French or Haitian Creole. "" I am calling for calm. Everything is under control , "" Joseph said on television alongside Police General Director Charles. "" This barbaric act will not remain unpunished "" . The first lady had been airlifted to Florida for treatment where she was in a stable condition , Joseph said. Haiti , a country of about 11 million people , has struggled to achieve stability since the fall of the Duvalier dynastic dictatorship in 1986 , and has grappled with a series of coups and foreign interventions. The U.N. Security Council condemned Moise ' s assassination and called on all parties to "" remain calm , exercise restraint and to avoid any act that could contribute to further instability. "" The council is due to be briefed on the killing in a closed-door meeting on Thursday. U.S. President Joe Biden denounced the killing as "" heinous "" and called the situation in Haiti - which lies some 700 miles ( 1,125 km ) off the Florida coast - worrisome. "" We stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti , "" he said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken , in a call with Joseph , expressed Washington ' s commitment to work with Haiti ' s government to support "" democratic governance , peace , and security , "" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. Many people in Haiti had wanted Moise to leave office. Ever since he took over in 2017 , he faced calls to resign and mass protests - first over corruption allegations and his management of the economy , then over his increasing grip on power. Lately , he presided over a worsening state of gang violence that rights activists say is linked to politics and business leaders using armed groups for their own ends. 1/10 A car from a funeral parlor drives past the coat of arms of Haiti ' s presidency while leaving the residential area where Haiti ' s President Jovenel Moise was shot dead at his private home by gunmen with assault rifles , in Port-au-Prince , Haiti July 7 , 2021. REUTERS/Estailove St-Val Read More In recent months , many districts of the capital Port-au-Prince had become no-go zones and one of Haiti ' s most powerful gang leaders warned he was launching a revolution against the country ' s business and political elites - although rights activists said he was more linked to Moise than the opposition. Moise himself had talked of dark forces at play behind the unrest : fellow politicians and corrupt oligarchs unhappy with his attempts to clean up government contracts and to reform Haitian politics. He provided no proof of this. FEARS OF UNREST The streets of the usually bustling capital were mostly deserted on Wednesday and the airport was closed although gunshots rang through the air. A caravan of vehicles including the ambulance carrying Moise ' s corpse to the morgue had to change route because of gunfire and roadblocks , according to local reports. With Haiti politically polarized and facing growing hunger , fears of a breakdown in order are spreading. The Dominican Republic closed the border it shares with Haiti on the island of Hispaniola , except to returning nationals , and beefed up security. "" This crime is an attack against the democratic order of Haiti and the region , "" Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader said. The U.N. Security Council expressed deep shock and sympathy over Moise ' s death ahead of a closed-door meeting on Thursday , requested by the United States and Mexico , to evaluate the situation. A U.N. peacekeeping mission - meant to restore order after a rebellion toppled then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004 - ended in 2019 with the country still in disarray. In recent years , Haiti has been buffeted by a series of natural disasters and still bears the scars of a major earthquake in 2010. POWER VACUUM Moise ' s murder comes amid a power vacuum. The banana exporter-turned-politician , who took office in 2017 , had ruled by decree for more than a year after the country failed to hold legislative elections. There are only 10 elected officials in the Haitian government , all of them senators. Just this week he nominated a prime minister to replace Joseph - who was only meant to be an interim PM - but the official has yet to be sworn in. The head of the Supreme Court of Justice died last month of COVID-19 amid a worrying surge in infections and has yet to be replaced. An extraordinary issue of the official gazette on Wednesday said the prime minister and his cabinet - meaning Joseph ' s government - would assume executive powers until a new president could be elected , as per Haiti ' s constitution. An election had already been scheduled for September , alongside a controversial referendum on a new constitution that Moise had said would help finally bring political stability to the country. Opposition leaders said it was part of his attempts to install a dictatorship by overstaying his mandate and becoming more authoritarian. He denied those accusations. The U.S. Embassy said it would be closed on Wednesday due to the "" ongoing security situation. "" The United States , which is Haiti ' s top aid donor and has long exerted an outsized weight in its politics , had on June 30 condemned what it described as a systematic violation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and attacks on the press in the country. The Biden administration urged the Haitian government to counter a proliferation of gangs and violence. The Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) expressed concern on Wednesday that the violence could deal a setback to efforts to fight COVID-19 in Haiti - one of only a handful of countries worldwide that has yet to administer a single shot of coronavirus vaccine.

22,"A massive brush fire Saturday in the Calabasas area forced mandatory evacuations as rapid flames consumed 516 acres and threatened 3,000 homes , the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. "" This is a fast-moving , dangerous fire , "" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Dennis Cross said. "" It ' s hard for people to see where this fire is because of the dense canopy and the canyons. "" The fire forced the mandatory evacuations of 5,000 people in the Highlands , Eddingham and Adamsville neighborhoods , fire officials said. "" Nobody can sit in their driveways or sit in their houses and ride this out. They need to get in their car and evacuate immediately , "" Cross said. As of 6 : 45 a.m. Sunday , the blaze was 30 percent contained , Capt. Keith Mora said. Homeowners were emotional as they packed their cars with anything they could grab and were forced to evacuate. Deputies grabbed hoses and began defending strangers ' townhomes before firefighters arrived. Residents living as far away as Studio City found ash sprinkled on their cars as smoke permeated through SoCal. The fire was reported at 4 p.m. in the area of 23062 Mulholland Highway , and began edging closer to homes. Old Topanga Boulevard was closed between Pacific Coast Highway and Cezanne Avenue as 1,000 firefighters , three water-dropping helicopters , and 24 engines were working to extinguish the blaze. At least three homes were damaged , fire officials said , in addition to a nature conservancy building at Mulholland Highway and Old Topanga Canyon Road that was completely gutted by the blaze. The fire was ignited after a driver lost control of a sport utility vehicle and crashed into power poles , downing lines in three different places , Mora said. All of the hot spots merged into one massive blaze , dubbed the "" Old Fire. "" A propane tank exploded into flames in front of Calabasas Klubhouse Pre-School as the heat from the fire crept closer to the structure , located at 3655 Old Topanga Canyon Road. A team of firefighters was defending the preschool. Initially , a few thousand Southern California Edison customers experienced power outages after the car slammed into the power pole , David Song of SoCal Edison said. By 7 p.m. , fewer than 200 were experiencing outages. Song said power should be fully restored by 3 p.m. Sunday. The Los Angeles County Fire Department reported that one firefighter suffered a minor injury while battling the blaze. The Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department ' s Lost Hills Station was in charge of evacuations. Residents were being evacuated to Agoura High School at 28545 West Driver Avenue. Anyone with large animals was asked to evacuate to Los Angeles Pierce College at 6201 Winnetka Avenue in Woodland Hills. The mandatory evacuations were extended to the zones in Old Topanga Canyon area until 8 a.m. , the California Highway Patrol said. Residents in the Calabasas area would be allowed to return home by 2 a.m. , but power may still be out , LA County Fire officials said. The large fire came as NBC4 Meteorologist Shanna Mendiola warned of excessive heat warnings across SoCal , along with dry winds. A second fire began burning at 4 : 20 p.m. in the West Hills area , the same time as the Old Fire. Light wind was fueling the two-acre blaze , pushing it downhill into a ravine at Kittridge Street and Valley Circle , according to LA County Fire. The blaze was about five miles north of the Calabasas blaze , and was extinguished by 6 : 40 p.m. , with no injuries or homes burned. Earlier in the morning , a brush fire in Temecula put drivers on high alert as it scorched 70 acres , forcing a closure of lanes on the southbound 15 Freeway. By the evening , and it was 20 percent contained. Another smaller blaze was reported in the Santa Clarita area amid rising temperatures , burning one-eighth of an acre near Decoro Drive and McBean Parkway. The Los Angeles County Fire Department compiled tips for what do if confronted with a fire. Experts advise to not stop to gather your belongings  just get out of the house if mandatory evacuations are ordered. "" Call the Fire Department from a neighbor  s telephone after you are out of the house , "" a tip sheet read. Calabasas is a city of about 24,000 residents in the hills west of the San Fernando Valley and northwest of downtown Los Angeles. It is home to several affluent gated communities and numerous celebrities. Read more here ."
23,"North Korea on Sunday carried out its most powerful nuclear test yet , an underground explosion that caused tremors that could be felt in China and South Korea. Pyongyang is claiming it tested a hydrogen bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the American mainland , and experts say the bomb has destructive capacity far beyond the one that destroyed Hiroshima. President Trump around noon on Sunday tweeted , "" I will be meeting General Kelly , General Mattis and other military leaders at the White House to discuss North Korea. "" He added that "" the United States is considering , in addition to other options , stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. "" More on the situation : story continues below NBC News also has video of Trump remarking , "" We ' ll see , "" after a reporter asks if he will attack North Korea. The Washington Post has published a history of nuclear tests and points out that North Korea is the only country to have performed one ( or six ) in the 21st century. It also explains the estimated yield ( meaning how much energy is released in an explosion ) was 100 kilotons , versus the yields of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , which were 15 and 21 kilotons , respectively. Per the BBC , the "" largest man-made explosion ever on Earth "" was the Soviet Union ' s Tsar Bomba in 1961 , at "" the height of the nuclear arms race. "" Deutsche Welle explains the differences between the hydrogen bomb Pyongyang claims it tested and the weaker atomic bomb : It really comes down to the "" detonation process. "" Trump responded to news of the test by criticizing South Korea on Twitter , writing "" their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work , they only understand one thing !

"" More on Trump ' s debate over whether to withdraw from a major trade deal with the South here. The Hill notes the perspective of a State Department official under Bush : "" This is no time to lecture South Korea or suspend free trade agreement. Best way to deter North Korea is to stand firmly with Seoul+Tokyo. "" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz appeared on ABC News ' The Week Sunday morning and was asked what he thought of Trump ' s handling of the situation. "" The president speaks in ways that I wouldn ' t speak , but that is his prerogative. I do think it helps for North Korea and for China to understand that we have a president who is strong.

Though the strength of the blast is undetermined , the artificial earthquake it caused was several times stronger than tremors generated by previous tests. It reportedly shook buildings in China and Russia. The test was carried out at 12 : 29pm local time at the Punggye-ri site where North Korea has conducted nearly all of its nuclear tests. Seoul put the magnitude at 5.7 , while the USGS said it was 6.3. North Korea ' s state-run television reported Sunday that Kim Jong Un attended a meeting of the ruling party ' s presidium and signed the go-ahead order. Earlier in the day , the party ' s newspaper printed photos of Kim examining what it said was a nuclear warhead being fitted onto the nose of an ICBM. story continues below North Korea in July test-launched two ICBMs believed to be capable of reaching the mainland US , reports the AP ; this is the North ' s first nuclear test since President Trump assumed office. The North claimed the device was a thermonuclear weapon  commonly called an H-bomb. That could be hard to independently confirm. It said the underground test site did not leak radioactive materials , which would make such a determination even harder. The North claims the device was made domestically and has explosive power that can range from tens to hundreds of kilotons. Outside experts suggested the yield might be in that ballpark , though closer to the lower range. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima had a 15-kiloton yield. Kim , according to the state-run KCNA , claimed all components of the device were domestically produced , which he said means the North can make "" as many as it wants. "" ( Read more North Korea stories. )|||||A 38 North exclusive with analysis by Frank V. Pabian , Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. and Jack Liu. New commercial satellite imagery confirms earlier 38 North analysis identifying numerous landslides throughout the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site on the slopes of Mt. Mantap ( and beyond ) resulting from North Korea  s sixth nuclear test. These disturbances are more numerous and widespread than seen after any of the North  s previous five tests , and include additional slippage in pre-existing landslide scars and a possible subsidence crater. However , it is unclear from the imagery whether this subsidence is due to what has been reported as a cave-in that was externally observable ,  associated with the 4.6 magnitude event that occurred eight minutes after the test. There also appears to be increased water drainage in the North Portal Area , likely stimulated by the large underground nuclear test. Such underground water flow stimulation ( brought about by expansion of existing cracks and fissures ) could also be expected to promote the transport of radionuclides to the surface , and is not inconsistent with a more recent report that some radionuclides ( traces of Xenon-133 ) were detected in the environment following the test ( by South Korea ) . Imagery from September 8 also shows a large tractor/trailer cargo truck in the South Portal Area for the first time , and mining carts and other equipment are present outside the West Portal. Such activity , coming shortly after the largest underground nuclear test conducted at Punggye-ri to date ( via the North Portal ) , suggests that onsite work could now be changing focus to further prepare those other portals for future underground nuclear testing. Revised Magnitude Estimates Raise the Equivalent Yield to Approximately One Quarter of a Megaton At the time of 38 North  s first report on the sixth nuclear test , the preliminary seismic magnitude estimates varied from 5.8 , as published by both the CTBTO and NORSAR , to 6.3 by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) . More recently , both the CTBTO and NORSAR have officially revised their estimates upward to 6.1. This revision is significant because , rather than providing an equivalent yield of about 120 kilotons derived from the lower magnitude estimates , the application of standard formula with appropriate constants shows that the yield can now be estimated to have been roughly 250 kilotons ( one quarter megaton ) . This large explosive yield is also quite close to what 38 North had previously determined to be the maximum estimated containable yield for the Punggye-ri test site. The CTBTO also published a very useful graphic illustrating the relative strength of this most recent and sixth underground nuclear test vis--vis the DPRK  s previous five acknowledged tests to date ( Figure 1 ) . Figure 1. Comparison of seismic signals of North Korea  s six nuclear tests by the CTBTO. Post-Test Commercial Satellite Imagery Multiple satellite images of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site following the nuclear test form a mosaic of new information on post-test effects and activities around the site. Mt. Mantap and Its Environs To date , we have only two seismically derived relative geo-location estimates for a more precise location of the September 3 test and both of them place the event under Mt. Mantap as shown in Figure 2A. The first , by the seismic analytical team at NORSAR , shows a roughly 700 meter wide error ellipse , while the second estimate by the Lianxing Wen  s Geogroup is a bit further to the west of the peak with a claimed error circle diameter of 200 meters. Both are consistent with our expectations that the North Koreans would seek to utilize the maximum available overburden ( ~800 meters ) at the site using the same North Portal as was used in the previous four tests. An apparent rectangular subsidence crater  appears in the stratified volcanics at the basalt escarpment lip on the western corner of Mt. Mantap ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . This crater  is likely what has been reported as a possible collapse chimney crater ,  but could also just be induced slippage prompted by the massive tremor. We may know more once synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) imagery becomes available to potentially plot the epicenter of all of the surface disturbances. Figure 2A. Geo-location estimates for September 3 test under Mt. Mantap. Figure 2B. Possible subsidence crater and several landslide scars visible in post-test imagery of Mt. Mantap.

For media options , please contact [ email protected ] A comparison of pre- and post-test imagery of the North Portal ( Figure 3 ) shows some changes. Most importantly , imagery of September 4 showed a significant increase in the water drainage flow emanating from the tunnel used in the conduct of this test , suggesting that the tremors had likely stimulated that increased flow. On September 7 ( Figure 4 ) , what appeared to be two white vehicles were parked near the North Portal. ( Note : The appearance of such vehicles is not a common occurrence and their presence could be indicative of a post-test inspection effort. ) Recent rains converted much of the area from dry earth to mud , but no evidence of landslides was visible in the immediate vicinity of the North Portal. Other small , unidentified , objects were also noted in the parking apron located on the south side of the engineering operations building. More recent imagery from September 8 ( Figure 5 ) shows that the white vehicles are no longer present. Figure 3. Pre- and post-test imagery of the North and West Portals. Images  2017 Planet Labs , Inc. cc-by-sa 4.0. Figure 4. White vehicles identified near the North Portal on September 7. Figure 5. While white vehicles no longer present near the North Portal , equipment or mining carts are identified near the West Portal on September 8. The West Portal 38 North reported new equipment being present outside of the West Portal on imagery from August 27 , which was the first significant activity in that area since late March. The most recent imagery from September 8 shows some mining carts on the rail line that extends from the West Portal to the spoil pile. This may be a prelude to new tunnel excavation activity ( Figure 5 ) . The South Portal For the first time in over a year , activity was noted within the South Portal Area. A large tractor/trailer cargo truck was located in the area between the primary and secondary tunnel portals ( Figure 6 ) . The purpose of the vehicle is as yet unknown. Figure 6. Activity noted at the South Portal in over one year. The Main Administrative Support Area Pre- and post-test imagery of the main administrative support area ( Figure 7 ) shows little change and no obvious vehicle tracking. The spatial resolution and the perspective of the post-test imagery were insufficient to determine whether or not the monument/pavilion observation point had been removed. The greenhouse remains uncovered. Imagery from September 8 ( Figure 8 ) shows a few minor changes , including the possible removal of the propaganda placards , although additional imagery from a more southerly perspective would be necessary to confirm.

The Command Center A comparison of pre- and post-test imagery of the Command Center ( Figure 9 ) shows that a long white truck had been moved next to a vehicle parking shed located inside the courtyard of the Command Center in imagery from September 4. New vehicle tracking was also present in the courtyard area. However , that white truck was no longer present in imagery from September 7 ( Figure 10 ) . It is possible that this vehicle was involved in the transfer of test support equipment associated with the most recent test , although we cannot confirm this based on imagery alone. Figure 9.

Other New Reporting There was also one report of concern that Mt. Mantap might actually collapse as a result of the nuclear testing beneath it. Such reports of the mountain  s demise are highly exaggerated , although there is little doubt that there would have been significant cracking  ( possibly extending to the surface ) as well as significant irreversible strain  resulting from this event. Such cracking facilitates radioactive gas seepage in other environments. It remains to be seen , however , whether or not the North Portal will ever be used for another nuclear test. There are still two unused additional tunnel complexes ( served by the South and West Portals ) that are also deemed potentially capable of further nuclear testing , albeit for tests having lower yields than that of the sixth test. Conclusions Some of North Korea  s key claims , such as having conducted a large underground nuclear test ( with a device capable of yielding hundreds of kilotons  ) have apparently now been corroborated , and evidently including the claim of having detonated a hydrogen  bomb : The United States has tentatively concluded that North Korea detonated an H-bomb over the weekend , as the regime has claimed , a senior U.S. administration official said Thursday.  However , the claim that no radioactivity was released may not be true. Detection of radioactive xenon-133 has been since reported in South Korea , although the official statement by the South Korean Nuclear Safety Agency was that , The agency is currently tracking down the inflow of the material to conclude whether it is a result of the nuclear test.  Additional information on the type and extent of the radionuclide dispersal will likely be addressed by the CTBTO in the near future. We also see no reason to alter our previous assessment that regardless of whether this most recent test was an operational warhead for an ICBM or simply a device , the yield of the test clearly shows North Korean progress in increasing the yields of their nuclear weapons. The significance of this is that it has the potential to dramatically increase the threat posed by its Strategic Force ( responsible for ballistic missiles ) as individual nuclear warheads potentially now have 10-times ( or more ) greater destructive power. This would allow fewer missiles to be employed to ensure destruction of a given target , and increase the target areas threatened by North Korean ICBMs by allowing a larger number of targets to be engaged with the current missile inventory. If the claim that the device just tested has a variable yield is true ( from tens to hundreds of kilotons ) , then this may also imply the North Koreans intend to adopt an expanded policy of using nuclear weapons , including tactical use , in addition to deterring threats to existence of the state. By doing so , they would join countries such as the United States , Russia , China , Pakistan , etc. that have policies regarding the use of tactical nuclear weapons , [ 1 ] clearly further destabilizing the Korean peninsula situation ."
24,"AP Photo The 21 Hillary Clinton emails you must read From the hPad ' s arrival to Sid Blumenthal ' s rant on Boehner , these are the gems in the latest batch of Hillary ' s emails. The State Department ' s largest release to date of Hillary Clinton ' s emails provided a deeper look into the former secretary of state ' s thinking on major political events , revealed the extent to which longtime confidant Sidney Blumenthal had her ear , and offered a range of lighter insights , from her take on snow days ( "" this is getting silly "" ) to her amusement at a robber carrying out a heist with a Hillary mask. Here are the must-read emails , from the more than 7,000 pages of messages released on Monday night : Hillary and the help desk In late February 2010 , Clinton received a message to her personal email from an inquisitive help desk analyst with the State Department , informing the owner of the account that one of the department ' s "" customers "" was receiving "" permanent fatal errors "" from the address. Clinton then forwarded the email to aide Huma Abedin , who explained that the help desk "" had no idea it was YOU , just some random address. "" "" But regardless , means ur email must be back ! R u getting other messages ? "" Abedin asked. Clinton responded : "" I ' ve gotten some messages from yesterday  how about you ? "" The hPad arrives Philippe Reines emailed Clinton in June 2010 letting her know that her iPad  or as he put it in the subject line , the "" hPad ""  had arrived. "" That is exciting news  do you think you can teach me to use it on the flight to Kyev next week ? "" Clinton said. Blumenthal emails on "" vast right wing conspiracy "" With the subject line "" H : Yes , there is a vast right wing conspiracy , "" Blumenthal forwarded an article from The New Yorker ' s Jane Mayer exploring how the Koch brothers had funded the tea party movement and right wing of the Republican Party. "" Ah , a little lite vacation reading ! "" Clinton responded in the August 2010 exchange. Blumenthal emails on "" post-midterms strategy "" On Election Day 2010 , Blumenthal gave Clinton his take on the state of play after the midterms , in which Republicans would retake control of the House and John Boehner would ascend to the speakership. "" Boehner is despised by the younger , more conservative members of the House Republican Conference. They are repelled by his personal behavior , "" Blumenthal wrote , in part. "" He is louche , alcoholic , lazy , and without any commitment to any principle. Boehner has already tried to buy the members with campaign contributions and committee assignments , which he has already promised to potentially difficult members. "" Blumenthal on the tea party In an August 2010 memo titled "" Some paragraphs on the tea party , "" Blumenthal characterized the Republican Party as "" captive to the swamp fevers of the extreme right "" and being "" purged of moderates , responsible conservatives , anyone who has a thought they don ' t like. "" "" Not useless "" advice In another Blumenthal email titled "" an idea , perhaps useless , but nonetheless ... , "" he ponders with regard to Clinton ' s Israeli strategy , "" This may be worthless meandering on my part , but if the US unveils its own position in the new negotiations , inevitable if they are not to collapse , perhaps that position should incorporate at its heart what the Israeli government has already agreed to in the final status negotiations at Camp David , along , of course , with certain adjustments arid amendments to account for the past ten years in terms of boundaries , etc. "" This , he wrote , would make the U.S. look more reasonable. "" Not useless  thx , "" Clinton responded. "" Don ' t operate from blank slate or allow Bibi to set the terms. There are already terms , "" Blumenthal wrote back. Clarence Thomas impeachment Blumenthal shared amemofrom David Brock in which Brock outlines the case for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on the grounds of revelations from recent reports in The New York Times , The Washington Post and Washington ' s ABC affiliate. "" Brock memo here , have many more ideas on this. S. , "" reads the subject line. Clinton on Citizens United "" FYI : Any foreign nation or leader with a front company becomes a ' person ' under US law , "" Blumenthal wrote in the subject line of his email sent in the days after the Supreme Court decidedCitizens United v. FEC. "" This is unbelievable. Or maybe totally so given the forces at work , "" Clinton wrote in response to an article shared in the email. Blumenthal suggested the possibility of a legislative fix , something about which Clinton seemed skeptical. "" Not sure there is a legislative fix. Haven ' t read the opinion yet. May require constitutional amendment , "" she responded. "" Our friend , Martin "" Clinton had warm words for a future Democratic primary opponent in an email with Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski , thanking the senator for her support and declaring that Maryland Gov. Martin O ' Malley "" should be reelected by acclamation for steering the ship of state so well. "" "" Pls give him my best wishes , "" she wrote. Elena Kagan ' s cell Clinton attempted to call the then-Supreme Court nominee on her cellphone in May 2010 but was apparently unsuccessful. "" The cell # for her belongs to someone else according to the vm. Can you get the right cell # ? "" Clinton wrote to aide Lauren Jiloty , who said it was likely for one of Kagan ' s own aides. Nearly 100 hours without sleep The secretary made sure to thank an aide who was up "" for almost 100 hours "" to finish a speech , according to adviser Lissa Muscatine. "" I did once before speech and will do again. Thx to all , "" she wrote. Chelsea writes "" Mom , Dad "" on Haiti Chelsea Clinton addressed a memo on Haiti to "" Mom , Dad "" in an assessment of the efficacy of agencies responding to the 2010 Haiti earthquake disaster after spending four days in the country with Partners in Health. "" Diane Reynolds "" a.k.a. Chelsea on Iran "" I ' ve always wanted to go to Qom , and Iran too admittedly , as you know , more for the far history than recent I confess , "" Chelsea wrote to Coco Reynolds in an email chain later forwarded on to her mother , the secretary. "" I can ' t sort out whether I want to go more or less now though because of recent turmoil/promise/discontent ; maybe want and sense are merely opposing forces ! "" Chelsea ' s website complaint In a partially redacted message , Chelsea , writing again as Reynolds , complained to her "" favorite secretary of state "" about State ' s website. "" I i cant see video of your talks or q&a sessions  only the text ! i think there should be links to the news ' versions if there is not state-created footage , "" Chelsea wrote , which the secretary then forwarded to Reines and Abedin , asking them to check on it "" for us. "" Lanny Davis favor Longtime Clinton friend Lanny Davis emailed Clinton in September 2010 asking the secretary if she could speak with a reporter from The American Lawyer about their professional relationship , and if not , if she would have Reines or Cheryl Mills do so on her behalf. "" Please please please * note there are *three please* : *Do not be bashful or concerned about saying no to my request. As you can see , I have a number of people who have talked to the reporter or , in the case of President Clinton and President Bush , who may be giving written statements , "" Davis wrote. Clinton forwarded the email to those aides , asking for advice. Their responses are heavily redacted. Gallup poll Abedin and Mills each forwarded a Gallup/USA Today poll in late December 2010 that found Clinton ranking as the "" most-admired "" woman for the ninth year in a row. TV shows for the New Year Clinton opened 2010 by asking aide Monica Hanley to , among other things , give her the times of two TV shows  "" Parks and Recreation "" and "" The Good Wife ""  which she recentlynamedas one of her favorite shows. The case of the robber ' s Hillary mask The secretary of state commented on an article reporting on a man in Virginia who robbed a bank wearing a Hillary Clinton Halloween mask in late December 2010. "" She does , uh , have an alibi , I presume ? "" lawyer David Kendall deadpanned in the email chain. Clinton ' s response : "" Should I be flattered ? Even a little bit ? And , as for my alibi , well , let ' s just say it depends on the snow and the secret service. So , subject to cross for sure. Do you think there could be copycats ? Do you think the guy chose that mask or just picked up the nearest one ? Please keep me informed as the case unfolds. "" No more snow days ? "" I can ' t believe the govt is closed again. I guess I will work from home again but think this is silly , "" Clinton wrote of the federal government ' s decision to close its doors for another day on the night of Feb. 8 , 2010. The next day , the storm dumped approximately 10 inches on Washington , in addition to massive totals from the previous week ' s "" Snowmageddon "" event. "" Pls don ' t forward my last email "" Clinton instructed aide Mills and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah not to forward her emails for reasons that are unclear because the email is redacted. "" Cheryl and Raj  I sent you emails [ redacted ] forward to anyone and delete after reading. Thx. before removing their email info so pls do not , "" Clinton wrote.

Department officials say the redacted information was classified in preparation for the public release of the emails and not identified as classified at the time Clinton sent or received the messages. All the censored material in the latest group of emails is classified at the "" confidential "" level , not at higher "" top secret "" or compartmentalized levels , they say. "" It ' s somewhere around 150 that have been subsequently upgraded "" in classification , State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters. story continues below Still , the increasing amounts of blacked-out information from Clinton ' s email history as secretary of state will surely prompt additional questions about her handling of government secrets while in office and that of her most trusted advisers. The Democratic presidential front-runner now says her use of a home email server for government business was a mistake , and government inspectors have pointed to exchanges that never should have been sent via unsecured channels. Toner insisted that nothing encountered in the agency ' s review of Clinton ' s documents was marked as classified. "" Classification  we  ve said this many times  is not an exact science , "" he says , per Politico. "" There  s many strong opinions.  It ' s not up to me to litigate these kinds of questions from the State Department podium. "" ( Read more Hillary Clinton stories. )|||||Hillary Rodham Clinton fretted about gefilte fish , Henry Kissinger and how to use an iPad in some 7,000 pages of email newly disclosed by the State Department late Monday. What she did not appear to do was write any explosive messages that will give her opponents new fodder for attack in the presidential campaign. And so it goes with the Clinton emails. The process the former secretary of State used to send and receive the messages while the nation ' s top diplomat have created an enduring political headache for Clinton. But the messages themselves -- a new tranche disclosed monthly under orders from a judge -- have yet to leave additional political scars. Of course , not all the messages she sent and received on her now-notorious home server are being revealed. Clinton had already deleted all the messages she deemed personal , a move rivals say is suspicious. And some 125 of the latest batch of Clinton emails released by the State Department were withheld from the public ; government reviewers ruled they contained information that was retroactively classified. Still , the messages did offer rare insight into the daily happenings in Clintonworld. In one particularly amusing exchange , it is revealed that even the Help Desk at the State Department was confused by Clinton ' s emailing ways. "" They had no idea it was YOU , "" Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote of the perplexed tech staff who were trying to figure out who owned one of the email addresses that belonged to Clinton. Some other notable exchanges : > In an email titled "" Gefilte Fish , "" Clinton messaged top aides : "" Where are we on this ? "" It apparently involved a more complex discussion than what was going on Clinton ' s Seder table. > Another message reveals that Clinton is a fan of "" Parks and Recreation. "" ( Also "" The Good Wife , "" but that is old news. ) > Clinton seemed particularly excited about the arrival of her iPad , arranging for her top communications aide , Philippe Reines , to provide a tutorial on an upcoming flight to Kiev. Subject line : hPad. > An email with the subject line "" Loretta Sanchez , "" as in the congresswoman from Garden Grove , is redacted entirely. > Then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice , now President Obama ' s national security advisor , is given Clinton ' s personal email address with the offer from Clinton to use it anytime , "" whatever my current address may be ! "" > Reines praises Clinton in May 2010 for calling out the "" ogrish males "" at the State Department for their "" eye rolls "" on women ' s issues. > Chelsea Clinton makes an appearance , writing a long , impassioned memo to both of her parents on the recovery effort in Haiti from the 2010 earthquake , insisting that immediate action is needed to save the lives of tens of thousands children who are at risk of contracting deadly diseases. >And a clutch of emails from a longtime Clinton confidante , Sidney Blumenthal , who was blocked by the White House from working for Clinton at the State Department : Without "" tough love , any support for Israel will lack credibility , "" he writes in one that he himself marked confidential. In another , he refers to House Majority Leader John Boehner as : "" a louche , alcoholic , lazy , and without any commitment to any principle . ""|||||WASHINGTON  Chelsea Clinton warned her parents that international relief efforts in Haiti were a disaster and that major changes were needed in a memo released on Monday that offered a rare window into her role in America  s most prominent political family. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw  and didn  t see  would be an understatement ,  Ms. Clinton wrote in a memo addressed to Dad , Mom  and attached to an email she sent while her mother was secretary of state and her father was leading relief efforts for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. The incompetence is mind numbing.  Reporting back on a four-day trip to Haiti , Ms. Clinton added , If we do not quickly change the organization , management , accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground , we could quite conceivably confront tens of thousands of children  s deaths by diarrhea , dysentery , typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future.  The message hinted at the largely hidden role the former first daughter has played over the years as an agent and adviser to her famous parents , an invisible soldier ,  as she described herself in that memo. With her mother now back on the presidential campaign trail , Chelsea Clinton has been increasingly in the spotlight as she has exercised oversight over the family foundation and taken a more visible place in the family  s quest to return to the White House ."
25,"This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the stock market , business news and the economy . A second Google A.I. researcher says the company fired her. Image Margaret Mitchell , who was one of the leaders of Google  s Ethical A.I. team , sent a tweet on Friday afternoon saying merely : I  m fired.  Credit ... Cody O ' Loughlin for The New York Times Two months after the jarring departure of a well-known artificial intelligence researcher at Google , a second A.I. researcher at the company said she was fired after criticizing the way it has treated employees who were working on ways to address bias and toxicity in its artificial intelligence systems. Margaret Mitchell , known as Meg , who was one of the leaders of Google  s Ethical A.I. team , sent a tweet on Friday afternoon saying merely : I  m fired.  Google confirmed that her employment had been terminated. After conducting a review of this manager  s conduct , we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct ,  read a statement from the company. The statement went on to claim that Dr. Mitchell had violated the company  s security policies by lifting confidential documents and private employee data from the Google network. The company said previously that Dr. Mitchell had tried to remove such files , the news site Axios reported last month. Dr. Mitchell said on Friday evening that she would soon have a public comment. Dr. Mitchell  s post on Twitter comes less than two months after Timnit Gebru , the other leader of the Ethical A.I. team at Google , said that she had been fired by the company after criticizing its approach to minority hiring as well as its approach to bias in A.I. In the wake of Dr. Gebru  s departure from the company , Dr. Mitchell strongly and publicly criticized Google  s stance on the matter. More than a month ago , Dr. Mitchell said that she had been locked out of her work accounts. On Wednesday , she tweeted that she remained locked out after she tried to defend Dr. Gebru , who is Black. Exhausted by the endless degradation to save face for the Upper Crust in tech at the expense of minorities  lifelong careers ,  she wrote. Dr. Mitchell  s departure from the company was another example of the rising tension between Google  s senior management and its work force , which is more outspoken than workers at other big companies. The news also highlighted a growing conflict in the tech industry over bias in A.I. , which is entwined with questions involving hiring from underrepresented communities. Today  s A.I. systems can carry human biases because they learn their skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. Because the researchers and engineers building these systems are often white men , many worry that researchers are not giving this issue the attention it needs. Google announced in a blog post yesterday that an executive at the company , Marian Croak , who is Black , will oversee a new group inside the company dedicated to responsible A.I. A Fed president predicts the Bitcoin boom won  t last. Image Eric Rosengren , left , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , with the Fed  s chair , Jerome H. Powell , in 2019. Credit ... Brendan McDermid/Reuters The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston says he expects a winning streak for the digital currency Bitcoin to eventually come to an end. Personally , I  ve been surprised that Bitcoin has continued to flourish ,  Eric Rosengren , the head of the regional central bank , said in an interview with The New York Times on Friday. The digital currency is trading at more than $ 50,000 per coin and on Friday surged to a market value of more than $ 1 trillion. That increase has been helped along as big companies like Tesla and finance firms like Bank of New York Mellon increasingly embrace Bitcoin. But Mr. Rosengren said he could not see a long-lived use case for Bitcoin in a world where central banks were likely to offer their own alternatives eventually. I would suspect , down the road , that a number of central banks will have digital currency ,  he said. When there is a digital currency available , other than the underground economy , it  s not clear why people would use Bitcoin.  I would expect , over time , Bitcoin prices to come under pressure ,  he continued. Mr. Rosengren noted that China and Sweden were well along in thinking about digital currencies , and that the Boston Fed was also researching the possibility for the United States. The Fed  and especially its chair , Jerome H. Powell  has been clear that it will tread very carefully into the digital currency space , given the important role the U.S. dollar plays in the global economy. Some smaller central banks have been more experimental. The Bahamian central bank introduced the Sand Dollar , a central bank digital currency , last year.

Image Neera Tanden , President Joe Biden  s nominee for Director of the Office of Management and Budget , during a Senate hearing earlier this month. Credit ... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Senator Joe Manchin III , Democrat of West Virginia , announced on Friday that he would oppose Neera Tanden , President Biden  s nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget , imperiling her prospects in an evenly divided Senate. The fate of the nomination is now in the hands of a party Ms. Tanden has frequently criticized. She would need the support of at least one Republican senator in order to be confirmed , with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a tie. Given Ms. Tanden  s litany of critical public statements and tweets against members of both parties before her nomination , it is unclear whether such support exists  or if other Democrats will also come forward in opposition. In a statement released Friday , Mr. Manchin cited comments from Ms. Tanden that were personally directed at Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , now the minority leader ; Bernie Sanders , the Vermont independent now in charge of the Senate Budget Committee ; and other colleagues. I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget ,  Mr. Manchin said. For this reason , I cannot support her nomination. As I have said before , we must take meaningful steps to end the political division and dysfunction that pervades our politics.  The White House signaled on Friday that it was not ready to withdraw Ms. Tanden  s nomination. Neera Tanden is an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent budget director , and we look forward to the committee votes next week and to continuing to work toward her confirmation through engagement with both parties ,  Jen Psaki , the White House press secretary , said in a statement. Ms. Tanden faced tough grilling from both Republicans and Democrats during her two confirmation hearings earlier this month. Republicans spent the first hour of her first hearing before a Senate homeland security committee asking Ms. Tanden to explain her past Twitter posts and why she had deleted more than 1,000 tweets shortly after the November election. Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio , read aloud posts in which she called Mr. McConnell Moscow Mitch  and said that vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz ,  a Republican senator from Texas. Her second hearing was no less fiery , with Mr. Sanders confronting her over her history of leveling personal attacks on social media , including at him. Ms. Tanden and Mr. Sanders have clashed since the 2016 election , with Mr. Sanders accusing her in 2019 of maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas.  Ms. Tanden apologized to lawmakers during both hearings , saying she regretted many of her previous remarks. I deeply regret and apologize for my language , some of my past language ,  Ms. Tanden said. I recognize that this role is a bipartisan role , and I recognize I have to earn the trust of senators across the board.  The Fed offers a hopeful , but also watchful , outlook to Congress. Image A help wanted  sign at a Target in Westwood , Mass. The labor market has rebounded , but the pace of hiring has slowed , the Federal Reserve said in a report. Credit ... Steven Senne/Associated Press The Federal Reserve released its twice-annual monetary policy report to Congress on Friday , offering an assessment of the economy that was at once hopeful and cautious as vaccines stoke the prospects of an economic recovery , but risks crowd the horizon. While unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and a relaxation of rigorous social-distancing restrictions supported a rapid rebound in the U.S. labor market last summer , the pace of gains has slowed and employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels ,  the central bank said in the report. The Fed used the missive , which comes ahead of testimony by the Fed chair , Jerome H. Powell , before a Senate committee on Tuesday and a House committee on Wednesday , to underline the uneven economic costs of the pandemic. The report included a special box dedicated to those disparities. Job losses last spring were disproportionately severe among lower wage workers , less-educated workers , and racial and ethnic minorities , as in previous recessions , but also among women , in contrast to previous recessions ,  the Fed noted. Childcare burdens resulting from school closures are an important factor holding back women  s participation in the labor force , the central bank said. Among mothers between the ages of 25 to 54 with children between the ages of 6 and 17 , the share who said they were out of the labor force because of caregiving responsibilities was up 2.5 percentage points in the three months ending January 2021 compared with the same period a year earlier , the Fed said , based on staff calculations of government data. That increase for mothers exceeded a 0.5 percentage point increase for fathers. The report also pointed to possible financial risks down the road. It noted that banks and other financial institutions have held up well so far , but that they may experience additional losses as a result of rising defaults in the coming years.  Plus , longstanding vulnerabilities at money market mutual funds and open-end investment funds remain unaddressed ,  the Fed said.

The winter storms that wreaked havoc across the South and Midwest have affected futures for oil and natural gas prices. Credit ... Joe Raedle/Getty Images Energy Oil and natural gas futures fell after jumping earlier in the week. Both were affected by the fierce winter storms that caused millions of people to go without power across Texas this week. West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. benchmark crude , dropped 2.5 percent on Friday , to about $ 59 a barrel. It had jumped 6 percent from Friday to Wednesday , as oil production was hindered by the weather. Natural gas futures , which rose as a result of the storms , have moved up and down in recent days. On Friday , they ended down 0.4 percent after dropping as much as 3 percent earlier in the day. They still remain elevated from last week. Word that the Biden administration was offering to restart talks to restore an accord limiting Iran  s nuclear program was seen as weighing on oil prices. Lifting sanctions against Iran could allow it sell more oil on the global market. Brent crude , the international benchmark , was down 2 percent on Friday , to $ 62.68 a barrel. Stock markets The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent , bringing its total losses for the week to 0.7 percent. The benchmark index fell every day this week after a string of gains last week. ( There were not four consecutive days of gains , as was earlier stated here. ) Shares of Uber dropped 1 percent after Britain  s Supreme Court ruled that the company  s drivers must be classified as workers entitled to a minimum wage and vacation time. The case had been closely watched because of its ramifications for the gig economy. European markets were broadly higher , with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.5 percent and FTSE 100 in Britain gaining 0.1 percent. Asian markets closed mixed , with the Nikkei in Japan down 0.7 percent while the Shanghai composite in China rose 0.6 percent. Economic data Purchasing managers  index data for February , from Markit , showed a variety of trends across Europe. The France composite output index hit a three-month low , reflecting the restrictions on business activity imposed by the latest lockdown. The Germany composite index rose , helped by an export-led manufacturing upturn. In Britain , retail sales fell 8.2 percent in January compared with the preceding month , government data said , a downturn that was sharpened by a lockdown that started in the new year. But the decline was less than expected , and also not as bad as the 22 percent drop seen in April , when Britain went into an earlier lockdown. The Office of National Statistics said some of the improvement probably came from businesses learning to adapt to lockdowns , with more online and click-and-collect sales.

Credit ... Lm Otero Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press The chief executives of Facebook , Google and Twitter will face skeptical lawmakers again next month when a congressional committee questions them about the ways disinformation spreads across their platforms. The House Energy and Commerce Committee said Thursday that it would hold a hearing on March 25 with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook , Sundar Pichai of Google and Jack Dorsey of Twitter. The committee has been examining the future of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , a 1996 law that shields the platforms from lawsuits over much of the content posted by their users. The attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 , which included participants with ties to QAnon and other conspiracy theories that have spread widely online , has renewed concerns that the law allows the platforms to take a hands-off approach to extremist content. For far too long , Big Tech has failed to acknowledge the role they  ve played in fomenting and elevating blatantly false information to its online audiences ,  a group of the committee  s top Democrats said in a statement. Industry self-regulation has failed.  Andy Stone , a spokesman for Facebook , said the company believes it  s time to update the rules of the internet , and this hearing should be another important step in the process.  The House Judiciary Committee announced its own set of hearings on the tech industry on Thursday. It said it would hold multiple hearings on how to update antitrust laws to address the power of the tech giants. The committee questioned chief executives before concluding a lengthy investigation into the companies last year. The Judiciary Committee  s first hearing will take place on Wednesday.

Samuel Zeller for The New York Times Renault , the French carmaker , reported a loss of 8 billion euros , or $ 9.7 billion , in 2020 as the pandemic gutted sales , but the company said that was profitable in the later part of the year. Most of the annual loss stemmed from Renault  s stake in its troubled partner , Nissan. Losses at the Japanese carmaker drained  5 billion from the bottom line , Renault said. In addition , Renault car sales plunged 20 percent for the year , to just short of three million vehicles. After a first half impacted by Covid-19 , the group has significantly turned around its performance in the second half ,  Luca de Meo , Renault  s chief executive , said in a statement , without giving a figure. He said that 2021 was set to be difficult given the unknowns regarding the health crisis as well as electronic components supply shortages.

27,"At least 232 people have been killed in a Brazilian nightclub fire sparked by what witnesses described as a flare or firework lit by members of a band performing onstage. Many of the victims died inhaling toxic fumes during the rush to escape through the venue ' s single exit , according to local media reports in the southern city of Santa Maria. Police Major Cleberson Braida Bastianello said officials counted 232 bodies brought for identification to a makeshift mortuary at the city gymnasium. He lowered the death toll from the 245 earlier believed killed. Television images showed smoke pouring out of the Kiss nightclub as shirtless , young male partygoers joined firefighters in wielding axes and sledgehammers , pounding at windows and walls to break through to those trapped inside. Teenagers sprinted from the scene desperately trying to find help others carried injured and burned friends away in their arms. "" There was so much smoke and fire , it was complete panic and it took a long time for people to get out , there were so many dead , "" survivor Luana Santos Silva told the Globo TV network. Silva added that firefighters and ambulances responded quickly after the fire broke out , but that it spread too fast inside the packed club for them to help. Michele Pereira , another survivor , told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper that she was near the stage and that the fire broke out after band members lit flares. "" The band that was onstage began to use flares and , suddenly , they stopped the show and pointed them upward. At that point the ceiling caught fire. It was really weak but in a matter of seconds it spread , "" Pereira said. After the fire was extinguished , bodies were ferried by truck to the gymnasium. The Globo newspaper said the first truck carried 67 bodies and the second 70. "" People started panicking and ended up treading on each other , "" a fire chief , Guido de Melo , told local media. Fire department officials will issue a detailed report after a full investigation. Many of the dead are likely to be students because Santa Maria is a university centre for the Rio Grande do Sul region and the usual class schedule had been disrupted by strikes .|||||SANTA MARIA , Brazil ( Reuters ) - A nightclub fire killed at least 233 people in southern Brazil early on Sunday when a band  s pyrotechnics show set the building ablaze and fleeing partygoers stampeded toward blocked and overcrowded exits in the ensuing panic , officials said. A policeman and rescue workers help a man in front of Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria , 187 miles ( 301 km ) west of the state capital of Porto Alegre , in this picture taken by Agencia RBS , January 27 , 2013. REUTERS/Germano Roratto/Agencia RBS The blaze in the university town of Santa Maria was ignited by sparks from pyrotechnics used by the band for visual effects. They set fire to soundproofing on the ceiling and the club rapidly filled with toxic smoke , local fire officials said. Most of those who died were suffocated by fumes , fire brigade Sergeant Robson Muller told Reuters. Others were crushed in the stampede. Smoke filled the place instantly , the heat became unbearable ,  survivor Murilo Tiescher , a medical student , told GloboNews TV. People could not find the only exit. They went to the toilet thinking it was the exit and many died there.  Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers , who at first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs , initially blocked patrons from leaving. The security staff relented only when they saw flames engulfing the ceiling. The tragedy , in a packed venue in one of Brazil  s most prosperous states , comes as the country scrambles to improve safety , security and logistical shortfalls ahead of the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Olympics , both intended to showcase the economic advances and first-world ambitions of Latin America  s largest nation. In Santa Maria , a city of more than 275,000 people , rescue workers and weary officials wept alongside family and friends of the victims at a local gymnasium being used as a makeshift morgue. It  s the saddest , saddest day of my life ,  said Neusa Soares , the mother of one of those killed , 22-year-old Viviane Tolio Soares. I never thought I would have to live to see my girl go away.  President Dilma Rousseff cut short an official visit to Chile and flew to Santa Maria , where she wept as she spoke to relatives of the victims at the gym. All I can say at the moment is that my feelings are of deep sorrow ,  said Rousseff , who began her political career in Rio Grande do Sul , the state where the fire occurred. News of the fire broke on Sunday morning , when local news broadcast images of shocked people outside the nightclub called Boate Kiss. Gradually , grisly details emerged. BARRIER OF THE DEAD  We ran into a barrier of the dead at the exit ,  Colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo , commander of the fire brigade in Rio Grande do Sul , said of the scene that firefighters found on arrival. We had to clear a path to get to the rest of those that were inside.  Officials said more than 1,000 people may have been in the club , possibly exceeding its legal capacity. Though Internet postings about the venue suggested as many as 2,000 people at times have crammed into the club , Pedroso de Melo said no more than half that should have been inside. He said the club was authorized to be open but its permit was in the process of being renewed. However , Pedroso de Melo did point to several egregious safety violations - from the flare that went off during the show to the locked door that kept people from leaving. The club  s management said in a statement that its staff was trained and prepared to deal with any emergency. It said it would help authorities with their investigation. When the fire began at about 2 : 30 a.m. , many revelers were unable to find their way out in the chaos. It all happened so fast ,  survivor Taynne Vendrusculo told GloboNews TV. Both the panic and the fire spread rapidly , in seconds.  Once security guards realized the building was on fire , they tried in vain to control the blaze with a fire extinguisher , according to a televised interview with one of the guards , Rodrigo Moura. He said patrons were getting trampled as they rushed for the doors , describing it as a horror film.  Band member Rodrigo Martins said the fire started after the fourth or fifth song and the extinguisher did not work. It could have been a short circuit , there were many cables there ,  Martins told Porto Alegre  s Radio Gaucha station. He said there was only one door and it was locked. A band member died in the fire. CLUB OWNER QUESTIONED One of the club  s owners has surrendered to police for questioning , GloboNews reported. TV footage showed people sobbing outside the club before dawn , while shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Rescue officials moved the bodies to the local gym and separated them by gender. Male victims were easier to identify because most had identification on them , unlike the women , whose purses were left scattered in the devastated nightclub. Local authorities said 120 men and 113 women died in the fire. Piles of shoes remained in the burnt out club , along with tufts of hair pulled out by people fleeing desperately. Firemen who removed bodies said victims  cell phones were still ringing. The disaster recalls other incidents including a 2003 fire at a nightclub in West Warwick , Rhode Island , that killed 100 people [ ID : nL1N0AW2NR ] , and a Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 that killed nearly 200. In both incidents , a band or members of the audience ignited fires that set the establishment ablaze. The Rhode Island fire shocked local and federal officials because of the rarity of such incidents in the United States , where enforcement of safety codes is considered to be relatively strict. After the Buenos Aires blaze , Argentine officials closed many nightclubs and other venues and ultimately forced the city  s mayor from office because of poor oversight of municipal codes. The fire early on Sunday occurred in one of the wealthiest , most industrious and culturally distinct regions of Brazil. Santa Maria is about 186 miles west of Porto Alegre , the capital of a state settled by Germans and other immigrants from northern Europe. Local clichs paint the region as stricter and more organized than the rest of Brazil , where most residents are a mix descended from native tribes , Portuguese colonists , African slaves , and later influxes of immigrants from southern Europe. Rio Grande do Sul state  s health secretary , Ciro Simoni , said emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. States from all over Brazil offered support , and messages of sympathy poured in from foreign leaders ."
28,"It  s enough to make any Californian  s hair stand on end : As UPI reports , California officials have issued an earthquake advisory warning of upcoming quakes along the state  s notorious San Andreas Fault. The news puts people in Ventura , San Diego , San Bernardino , Riverside , Orange , Los Angeles , Kern and Imperial Counties on alert for what UPI calls a major  quake. But is the warning , which has made a big splash on social media and TV news , reason to panic ? Probably not : According to the Governor  s Office of Emergency Services , which released the reminder , the likelihood of an earthquake of a magnitude 4.3 or higher along the San Andreas fault in the next week may be 0.03 to one percent greater than usual. The warning was issued after a swarm of nearly 200 small temblors along the San Andreas fault near the Salton Sea. As Shelby Grad writes for The Los Angeles Times , such quake swarms are common in the area , as the sea sits at the convergence of several faults and is located above a thin , shifting piece of Earth  s crust that  s always on the move. Though some hypotheses say that a series of small quakes means bigger ones to come , swarms come and go without causing a quake more often than not , according to the University of California at Berkeley  s Seismo Blog. In this case , experts agree despite the warning : USGS experts say it  s likely nothing else will occur , writes Colin Atagi for The Desert Sun The warning comes just a day after Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation expanding California  s early-warning system. As David Gorn reports for KPCC , the new system could give residents up to a minute  s warning if a large quake shakes the San Andreas fault  a system similar to that which exists in earthquake-prone Japan and Mexico. However , the warning system  s website notes that it will only provide notices after an earthquake begins. That means that people farther away from the quake  s point of origin are likely not to see much benefit. If the quake is large , however , it will affect a larger area , giving people farther away more time to prepare. It always makes sense to prep for an earthquake , as is being done with a new mobile earthquake simulator for residents of San Bernardino. But ultimately , writes the U.S. Geological Survey , it  s impossible for scientists to predict quakes themselves. Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake ,  the agency writes on its website. They do not know how , and they do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future.  Simple geology makes another big earthquake along the San Andreas fault all but inevitable  but until it actually happens , awareness , preparedness and probabilities are all anyone has to go on .|||||It ' s the most well-known US fault , but the San Andreas Fault ' s southern section hasn ' t been behind a major earthquake since a 7.9-magnitude temblor in 1857  and that ' s got Thomas Jordan worried , the Los Angeles Times reports. "" The springs on the San Andreas system have been wound very , very tight , "" Jordan , the director of the Southern California Earthquake Center , told Wednesday ' s National Earthquake Conference. "" And the southern San Andreas fault , in particular , looks like it ' s locked , loaded , and ready to go. "" The area ( which includes Los Angeles on its periphery ) is due for a major quake , Jordan says , adding it ' s imperative Southern California continue to prepare , following the example of LA in pushing quake retrofits for buildings , as well as protecting telecommunications and water systems. "" An earthquake on the San Andreas would really affect all of Southern California , "" said Jordan ' s SCEC colleague , Mark Benthien , per CBS Los Angeles. story continues below In tectonics-speak , the San Andreas Fault  which Curbed Los Angeles calls a "" ticking ... time bomb ""  is where the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate meet , and the Pacific Plate is shifting northwest of the North American one at a rate of 16 feet or so every century , ScienceAlert notes. That ' s a lot of tension that needs to be released , which would be devastating : A 2008 USGS study found a 7.8-magnitude quake on the San Andreas Fault ' s southern portion could cause 1,800 fatalities , 50,000 injuries , and $ 200 billion in damage. Other parts of the fault have also remained dormant even longer , including in San Bernardino County ( no major shakeup since 1812 ) and near the Salton Sea , more or less steady since the late 1600s. "" We are fortunate that seismic activity in California has been relatively low over the past century , "" Jordan said last year. "" But we know that tectonic forces are continually tightening the springs  making big quakes inevitable.

ShakeAlert is not earthquake prediction , rather a ShakeAlert Message indicates that an earthquake has begun and shaking is imminent. What is ShakeAlert ?  A short video about ShakeAlert and how it works [ 4.5 min ] . ( English or Spanish ) . Follow Us on Twitter : @USGS_ShakeAlert The U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) along with a coalition of State and university partners are now implementing Phase 3 of operations of the ShakeAlert  Earthquake Early Warning System for the West Coast of the United States. Many partnerships to utilize ShakeAlert in authentic environments such as utilities , hospitals , transportation systems , and educational environments are active today and more are being developed. In 2021 and beyond , the USGS and its partners will continue to expand these applications in coordination with state agencies in Washington , Oregon , and California. The primary project partners include : The Earthquake Threat Earthquakes pose a national challenge because more than 143 million Americans live in areas of significant seismic risk across 39 states. Most of our Nation  s earthquake risk is concentrated on the West Coast of the United States. Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) has estimated the average annualized loss from earthquakes , nationwide , to be $ 6.1 billion , with 73 % of that figure ( $ 4.5 billion ) coming from Washington , Oregon , and California , and 61 % ( $ 3.7 billion ) from California alone. In the next 30 years , California has a 99.7 % chance of a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake and the Pacific Northwest has a 10 % chance of a magnitude 8 to 9 megathrust earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone. Part of the Solution Today , the technology exists to detect earthquakes , so quickly , that an alert can reach some areas before strong shaking arrives. The purpose of the ShakeAlert system is to identify and characterize an earthquake a few seconds after it begins , calculate the likely intensity of ground shaking that will result , and make alerts available for delivery ( by over 40 ShakeAlert partners ) to people and infrastructure in harm  s way.This can be done by detecting the first energy to radiate from an earthquake , the Primary ( P ) wave energy , which rarely causes damage. Using P-wave information , ShakeAlert first estimates the location and the magnitude of the earthquake. Then , the anticipated ground shaking across the region to be affected is estimated and an alert is made available for delivery to devices that will initiate automated actions and people who will be prompted to take an action such as Drop , Cover , and Hold On. The method can provide warning before the Secondary ( S ) -wave arrives , bringing the strong shaking that usually causes most of the damage. Studies in Washington , Oregon , and California have shown that the warning time would range from seconds to a tens of seconds. ShakeAlert can give enough time to slow trains and taxiing planes , to prevent cars from entering bridges and tunnels , to move away from dangerous machines or chemicals in work environments and to take cover under a desk , or to automatically shut down and isolate industrial systems. Taking such actions before shaking starts can reduce damage and casualties during an earthquake. It can also prevent cascading failures in the aftermath of an event. For example , isolating utilities before shaking starts can reduce the number of fire initiations. For every earthquake , there is a region near the epicenter where alerts will not arrive before shaking begins because the ShakeAlert system needs time to detect the earthquake , issue an alert , and for USGS partners to distribute the alert. ShakeAlert System Goal The USGS will issue ShakeAlert Messages to facilitate the delivery of public alerts of potentially damaging earthquakes and provide warning parameter data to government agencies and private users on a region-by-region basis , as soon as the ShakeAlert system , its products , and its parametric data meet minimum quality and reliability standards in those geographic regions. The USGS began the testing of public notification in California in October of 2019 through the Wireless Emergency Alert system ( WEA ) and cell phone apps. ShakeAlert expanded the testing of public alerting to mobile devices to Oregon in March 2021 and Washington in May 2021. Current Status In the fall of 2018 the West Coast ShakeAlert system became sufficiently functional and tested to begin Phase 1 of alerting in California , Oregon , and Washington. Several of the 40+ commercial and institutional users are alerting personnel and taking automated actions ; an important step in a strategy of phased roll out leading to full public operation. ShakeAlert partners are working with both public and private mass alert system operators including FEMA , cellular carriers , mass notification companies , and others to provide broader public alerting. The USGS and its partners are working on a comprehensive education and training program to so that the public knows respond to alerts when they are received. In addition to these Phase 1 implementations , technical improvements to the ShakeAlert system are also part of the story. The sensor network has reached target density in the Los Angeles , San Francisco Bay and Seattle metro regions and version 2.0 of the ShakeAlert production system has been deployed. This version of the ShakeAlert system is produces both point source and line source earthquake solutions , has added ground motion estimation products , and the number of false and missed events has been reduced. ShakeAlert system version 2.0 has also satisfied government cybersecurity requirements and includes improved operational procedures. The ShakeAlert system is being developed by expanding and upgrading the infrastructure of regional seismic networks that are part of the Advanced National Seismic System ( ANSS ) , the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network ( PNSN ) and the California Integrated Seismic Network ( CISN ) . CISN is made up of the Southern California Seismic Network ( SCSN ) and the Northern California Seismic System ( NCSS ) . This enables the USGS and ANSS to leverage their substantial investment in sensor networks , data telemetry systems , data processing centers , and software for earthquake monitoring activities residing in these network centers. The ShakeAlert system has been sending live alerts to beta  users in California since January of 2012 and in the Pacific Northwest since February of 2015. Authorities The USGS will develop and operate the ShakeAlert system , and issue public notifications under the authorities of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program , as enacted by the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 , 42 U.S.C.  7704 SEC. 2.

A rapid succession of small earthquakes  three measuring above magnitude 4.0  began rupturing near Bombay Beach , continuing for more than 24 hours. Before the swarm started to fade , more than 200 earthquakes had been recorded. The temblors were not felt over a very large area , but they have garnered intense interest  and concern  among seismologists. It marked only the third time since earthquake sensors were installed there in 1932 that the area had seen such a swarm , and this one had more earthquakes than the events of 2001 and 2009. Update : Elevated risk for big San Andreas fault quake is dropping , scientists say  Related : Feeling earthquake anxiety ? Here  s what you can do  Advertisement The quakes occurred in one of California  s most seismically complex areas. They hit in a seismic zone just south of where the mighty San Andreas fault ends. It is composed of a web of faults that scientists fear could one day wake up the nearby San Andreas from its long slumber. The San Andreas fault  s southernmost stretch has not ruptured since about 1680  more than 330 years ago , scientists estimate. And a big earthquake happens on average in this area once every 150 or 200 years , so experts think the region is long overdue for a major quake. The swarm actually increased the likelihood of a much more major quake in Southern California , at least temporarily. According to the U.S. Geological Survey , as of Tuesday , the chances of a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake being triggered on the southern San Andreas fault over the next seven days were as high as 1 in 100 and as low as 1 in 3,000. Without the swarm , the average chance for such an earthquake striking on any given week is 1 in 6,000. Any time there is significant seismic activity in the vicinity of the San Andreas fault , we seismologists get nervous ,  said Thomas H. Jordan , director of the Southern California Earthquake Center , because we recognize that the probability of having a large earthquake goes up.  As seismic activity drops , the probability of having a large earthquake also decreases. Experts said it  s important to understand that the chance of the swarm triggering a big one , while small , was real. This is close enough to be in that worry zone ,  seismologist Lucy Jones said of the location of the earthquake swarm. It  s a part of California that the seismologists all watch.  The swarm began just after 4 a.m. Monday , starting earthquakes three to seven miles deep underneath the Salton Sea. The biggest earthquakes hit later that morning , a 4.3 , and then a pair later at night , another 4.3 followed by a 4.1. There was another burst of activity Tuesday night. The earthquakes hit in a sparsely populated area , less than four miles from Bombay Beach , population 171 , sitting on the edge of the Sonoran Desert. When swarms hit this area  the northern edge of the so-called Brawley Seismic Zone  it  s enough to give earthquake experts heartburn. And there  s reason for that. Just 12 hours after a 6.3 earthquake hit south of the Salton Sea in 1987 , an even larger temblor , a 6.6 , ruptured six miles away  the Superstition Hills earthquake. Salton Sea earthquakes ( Los Angeles Times ) No deaths were reported from the earthquake in this sparsely populated area , but it did suggest how an earthquake on one fault could add stress on another fault. The San Andreas fault is even closer to where Monday  s earthquake swarm hit  less than four miles away. When there  s significant seismicity in this area of the fault , we kind of wonder if it is somehow going to go active ,  said Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson. So maybe one of those small earthquakes that  s happening in the neighborhood of the fault is going to trigger it , and set off the big event.  And that could set the first domino off on the San Andreas fault , unzipping the fault from Imperial County through Los Angeles County , spreading devastating shaking waves throughout the southern half of California in a monster 7.8 earthquake. The southern San Andreas is actually seismically fairly quiet. It doesn  t really make noise. So to have something right next to the main strand making a little noise  you have to pay attention to how it might be transferring stress onto the main strand of the fault ,  said USGS research geologist Kate Scharer. And the problem with the southern San Andreas fault  the stretch from Monterey County to the Salton Sea  is that when it goes , it  s probably going to go big , such as with a magnitude 7 or higher quake , Scharer said. The San Andreas is also thought to be smoother than other faults , making it easier for an earthquake to keep plowing ahead into a longer , more powerful rupture , rather than ending as a smaller event , Hauksson said. There have been other earthquakes in past decades that have raised fears among scientists that they could wake the sleeping San Andreas. One of the biggest concerns came in 1992 , when the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake struck the Mojave Desert. That sparked aftershocks , including the magnitude 6.5 earthquake in Big Bear three hours later , and involved faults that were close to the San Andreas. We were at a high level of concern then ,  Jones said. And that lasted through the aftershock sequence through the next year , because the aftershocks were coming down and hitting the San Andreas.  A San Andreas earthquake starting at the Salton Sea has long been a major concern for scientists. In 2008 , USGS researchers simulated what would happen if a magnitude 7.8 earthquake started at the Salton Sea and then barreled up the San Andreas fault , sending shaking waves out in all directions. By the time the San Andreas fault becomes unhinged in San Bernardino County  s Cajon Pass , Interstate 15 and rail lines could be severed. Historic downtowns in the Inland Empire could be awash in fallen brick , crushing people under the weight of collapsed buildings that had never been retrofitted. Los Angeles could feel shaking for a minute  a lifetime compared with the seven seconds felt during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Shaking waves may reach as far as Bakersfield , Oxnard and Santa Barbara. About 1,600 fires could spread across Southern California. And powerful aftershocks larger than magnitude 7 could pulverize the region , sending shaking into San Diego County and into the San Gabriel Valley. The ShakeOut simulation says it  s possible that hundreds of brick and concrete buildings could fall , and even a few fairly new high-rise steel buildings. The death toll could climb to 1,800 people , and such an earthquake could cause 50,000 injuries and $ 200 billion in damage. ron.lin@latimes.com Twitter : @ronlin ALSO What are the odds of dying in an earthquake ?

The California Office of Emergency Services ( OES ) issued an earthquake advisory warning residents and officials in Ventura , San Diego , San Bernardino , Riverside , Orange , Los Angeles , Kern and Imperial counties that there was a greater possibility of a major earthquake through Oct. 4. More than 140 seismic events have been recorded near Bombay Beach beginning Monday ranging from magnitude 1.4 to 4.3 , according to U.S. Geological Services ( USGS ) seismologists. California is earthquake country. We must always be prepared and not let our guard down ,  said OES Director Mark Ghilarducci. The threat of an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault hasn  t gone away , so this is another important opportunity for us to revisit our emergency plans and learn what steps you need to take if a significant earthquake hits.  The swarm occurred in a region known as the Brawley seismic zone , which is located near a fault network that connects the southernmost end of the San Andreas fault with the Imperial fault. Scientists say some of the cross-faults are positioned to potentially add stress to the San Andreas fault and the San Jacinto fault system when they rupture. According to the USGS , preliminary data indicated a roughly one percent chance of a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake being triggered on the Southern San Andreas fault within the next seven days with the likelihood decreasing over time.  But in a tweet posted on Friday , seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones said the swarm is over &amp; increased risk mostly gone  . The most recent quake in the swarm above magnitude 2.4 was a magnitude 3.2 temblor that struck around 11 a.m. Thursday ."

But the threat wasn  t over , a sixth fatality was discovered , and public safety officials remained cautious about allowing the 38,000 evacuees to return home. Fire fighting conditions improved in and around Redding , as winds stayed calm throughout the day. We are very encouraged with the fire status in the city today ,  said Cal Fire incident manager Bret Gouvea in an afternoon press briefing. We  ve had no movement on the fire over the last day inside the city limits.  Even so , the death toll from the fire grew. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said a sixth person had been found dead Sunday. He wouldn  t say where the person died but added that the victim had received an evacuation notice but didn  t leave. In addition , seven people in Redding remain missing , he said. The deadly blaze , which had chewed through 95,000 acres , began surging into Trinity County , where the tiny community of Lewiston , with a population of about 1,100 , was evacuated late Saturday.

On Sunday , their plea to the thousands who fled was markedly different : Be patient about going home. We care about you , and we are moving as fast as we can to get you back into your homes ,  said Mike Hebrard , the Shasta County fire chief. We understand how that feels , a lot of us are evacuated as well. We are clearing areas and making it safe as fast as we can.  The Shasta County Sheriff  s Department did lift evacuation orders late Saturday for the Redding Ranchettes area , just south of the Win-River Casino. But officials were adamant about issuing a mass re-population  order for the bulk of the evacuees. Leonard Moty , a county supervisor who  s among the evacuees , added : Let the fire personnel make it safe before you go back.  There have been scattered reports of looting , and National Guard troops have been stationed at multiple road blocks around the city. Roger Moore , Redding  s police chief , said the department had beefed up patrol and will arrest people who can  t show a reason for being in an evacuated neighborhood. If we don  t arrest them for looting , we  ll arrest them for something else ,  he said. We are nipping it in the bud before it happens.  He said someone was arrested late Saturday on an illegal weapons charge. Carr Fire Red circles on this live-updating map are actively burning areas , as detected by satellite.

At the Shasta College evacuation center , Otis Bershers , 75 , was waiting anxiously for word that he and his wife , Carol , could return to their home in the city of Shasta Lake , north of Redding. They  ve been sleeping on cots on the lawn outside the college since late Thursday , and Otis Bershers is starting to run low on his medication. He has the chronic lung condition known as COPD , and breathing the smoky air isn  t good for him. But he declined an offer to go to the hospital and said he wouldn  t leave his wife or their cat , Smokey , who was tethered to their cots. God , I hope they lift it on my place ,  he said of the evacuation order. I want to go home. But as long as I got my cat and her , I can  t go wrong.  Stuart and Renee Bailey , sitting in their SUV outside their west Redding subdivision , were anxious to return home as well. Their property escaped the fire , and Stuart Bailey , a contractor , was hoping to stop in to pick up some tools for work. The couple also wanted to see if the home had been looted. Law enforcement personnel turned them away. But the Baileys said they understood the need to be cautious. When another couple got miffed at being denied entry to the neighborhood , the Baileys told them to stay calm. Cut them some slack ,  Stuart Bailey said , referring to the law enforcement officials. You  ll get in sooner or later.  The re-population process will be slow and will start with the areas that Cal Fire believes are safest from potential return of the fire , officials said. We don  t want to allow ( people ) back in , then if conditions change , have to re-evacuate ,  Bosenko said. We can  t open the floodgates. We have to do it in segments.  Utility crews are fixing gas lines and performing other repairs in preparation for re-population. By Sunday afternoon , Redding Electric Utility had restored power to 7,400 customers , leaving 600 without power , said utility director Dan Beans. PG&E crews were fanning out in evacuated neighborhoods to conduct a crucial re-population task : Cutting off gas lines at burnt-out homes that sit next to homes that were untouched by the fire. The fire was creating chaos at times along portions of the power grid in Shasta and Trinity counties. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had to evacuate personnel from hydro power plants in both counties , including massive Shasta Dam. We  ve been working really hard to keep the power on ,  said Reclamation spokeswoman Erin Curtis. It  s a region-wide issue that we  re dealing with across the fire area.  Cal Fire said 884 buildings had been destroyed , including 657 homes. The six people who have died include Melody Bledsoe , 70 , and her two great-grandchildren , Emily , 4 , and James , 5. The fire has also claimed Redding fire inspector Jeremy Stoke , 37 , and private bulldozer operator Don Ray Smith , 81. A GoFundMe account has been established for the Bledsoe family. A little more than $ 1,100 had been raised by Sunday afternoon. Temperatures in Redding were anticipated to remain uncomfortably high : 104 degrees Monday , 105 on Tuesday , according to the National Weather Service.

According to Reuters , Wayne Huntsman pleaded guilty to three counts of arson Friday for starting the 2014 King Fire in Northern California that took hundreds of firefighters a month to get under control. His sentence was increased because a number of firefighters were injured and 12 homes and dozens of other structures were destroyed. Thousands of residents were displaced by the fire. Huntsman originally pleaded not guilty to the charges. story continues below In September 2014 , a retired firefighter picked Huntsman up escaping the area of the blaze , the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Huntsman showed the man a video of himself standing between two fires. "" Listen , I got fire all around me , "" Huntsman says in the video. "" I ' m stuck in the middle , babe. "" The man made a recording of the video and turned it over to the authorities , who arrested Huntsman within days. The DA says Huntsman was trying to look like a hero in the video , but it appeared the fires were purposefully set because there were two of them and Huntsman seemed to be enjoying himself. Meanwhile , Huntsman ' s sister is accused of killing two young children , whose bodies were found in a storage locker in Redding , California , according to SFist.

The charges against 19-year-old Lawson Schalm are related to numerous suspicious fires in the area that began on April 19 , including a massive one that destroyed the CN trestle bridge. On Sunday , Mayerthorpe fire Chief Randy Schroeder confirmed Schalm was one of the volunteer firefighters called to actively battle that fire , as well as four other fires during the course of the spree. "" There ' s an unconditional love for my son , "" Albert Schalm said , his voice trembling. "" No matter how this ends up , there will always be a dinner plate at my table for my son. He is always welcome in my home. "" Albert Schalm said his son began working for the Mayerthorpe fire department when he was 15 years old and was considering a possible future with the department. "" We were shocked , "" he said. "" He was planning out his future and where it would go from there , and obviously some of that will be on hold for a while. "" Schalm is in custody and is scheduled to make his first court appearance in Stony Plain provincial court on Wednesday. Fire department shocked , chief says The CN bridge fire forced the evacuation of nearby schools and a trailer park with 38 mobile homes. Some Lac St. Anne County residents living nearby were also told to be ready to leave on one-hour notice. Fire chief Schroeder said last week almost three dozen firefighters from four different fire departments in the area were called to help douse the flames , alongside agriculture and forestry services members , helicopters and a water bomber.

He said the fire department is struggling to come to terms with the charges against one of their own. "" We ' re certainly very shocked , bewildered , wounded and a little hurt on the discovery of this , "" he said. "" The discovery that one of our own potentially lit 18 fires is definitely affecting our station , for sure. "" Schroeder and Mayerthorpe Mayor Kate Patrick said in a news release that members of the fire department will undergo "" critical incident stress debriefing , "" and that individual counselling will be available to all members over word of the charges. Schroeder said the department is still functioning normally and providing service as usual for the community , and also extending their support to the Schalm family. "" We understand that this has got to be a tremendously trying time for his family members , "" he said. ' There will always be a dinner plate at my table for my son ' Albert Schalm said he hasn ' t yet been able to speak with his son , but that the community has been supportive of the family.

31,"When automobile transportation and design was in its infancy , designers often looked to architectural sources as well as other then-current modes of transportation for inspiration. Some Horse-drawn coaches of the time featured doors similar to the French Doors found in homes , where two adjacent doors are hinged on the outside edge and open from center. This design was incorporated in some of the early "" Horseless carriages , "" a name given to very early automobiles since they were no longer moved by a Horse. Center-opening doors gave these coaches and carriages an elegant look , and they were convenient to enter and exit , especially for ladies wearing long skirts. As automobile engine displacement grew over the years , so did the speed at which automobiles were driven. This ushered in the era of automotive safety , as government regulators became more concerned about the cars people were driving. Perhaps the biggest motivator behind this movement at the time was Ralph Nader , whose book , Unsafe At Any Speed was largely critical of the automobile industry , and many of the car designs that Mr. Nader felt were unsafe for motorists. Automobiles built in the decades that followed the Horseless carriage era continued to offer rear-hinged doors , both as a convenience and as a styling touch. One of the dangers of this design was the possibility of a door coming open at speed. The theory is that the forward motion of the car could cause the door to fly open , possibly causing the unlucky person sitting next to the door to be pulled out of the car , or the door itself could be ripped from its hinges. It ' s debatable as to whether this was speculation or reality , but cars of this era did not have seat belts , so there was nothing to hold a passenger in the car. The term "" suicide doors "" was therefore placed on vehicles with the rear-hinged door configuration , the theory being that anyone inside was on a suicide mission because of the design. As the early fifties rolled around , horsepower and high speeds were all the rage. The center-opening , rear-hinged doors retained their "" suicide doors "" nickname due to the possibility of them coming open in a crash , throwing occupants onto the street. Door latching mechanisms at the time were not as secure as they would be a few years later , and it wasn ' t uncommon at the time for doors to open in severe crashes. Until recently , the last American automobiles to utilize center opening rear doors were the 1961-1969 Lincoln Continental , and the 1967-1971 Ford Thunderbird. Latching mechanisms on these cars were greatly improved , and after 1967 , doors could not be opened at all if they were locked , even from inside the car. This prevented a panicked passenger from accidentally grabbing the inside door handle in an accident , and opening the door. In fact , the 1967 Thunderbird and Lincoln Continental incorporated a "" rolling door lock "" feature into their optional power door locks. This included a sensor on the transmission that locked the doors automatically at 8 mph , and would not allow the doors to be unlocked until the car speed dropped to below 8 mph. Surprisingly , this convenience was only offered for one year. Real or otherwise , rear hinged door safety became a concern , and the design was not used for many years. But it appears that this design may be making a comeback , as several new models have debuted in recent years with this feature. In 1998 , Saturn introduced a coupe with a rear hinged door , and they are now appearing on some extended cab pickup trucks as well. However , there is a major functional difference. Most new vehicles require the front door to be open before the rear door can be opened , eliminating any danger of the rear door flying open as the vehicle speeds down the road. It ' s a shame that manufacturer ' s must take extreme steps to protect the public , as everyone knows the most important safety consideration is one that can ' t be built in : the vehicle occupants. If people drove more defensively , talked less on their cell phones , paid more attention to their driving , and obeyed traffic laws , we wouldn ' t need many of the safety features we have today. Ultimately , the safety of a vehicle and its occupants rests solely on the people operating those vehicles. 1961 Lincoln Continental Sedan interior view with rear suicide door open.

( The "" surprise "" among GM ' s discontinued vehicles. )|||||Every one of the 80 special edition Lincoln Continentals with "" suicide doors "" have already sold out , the company said Monday. Ford ' s premium brand debuted the formally named 80th Anniversary Lincoln Continental Coach Door Edition in mid-December. Within 48 hours of the car ' s debut , they were all gone. The car was sold on a first-come , first-serve basis , in contrast with the more involved buying process for the Ford GT supercar , which required prospective buyers to fill out an application. But the prices were still high  north of $ 110,000 for each. Lincoln said it will do another limited run next year , but the vehicles will be slightly different. The coach doors , also known as "" suicide doors , "" are a highlight of the car. The design , where the rear doors open toward the rear of the car , was once a common feature on Lincoln Continentals primarily in the 1960s. The limited edition ' s wheelbase is longer than on the standard model by about 6 inches. Every car comes with Lincoln ' s Black Label trim , the highest trim level available across Lincoln ' s lineup. Selling sedans is tough these days , to be sure. Customers tend to prefer SUVs , crossovers , and pickups. The Continental is one of only two sedans Lincoln still sells. The other is the mid-size MKZ , which comes in both standard internal combustion and hybrid versions. Lincoln sells four crossover and SUV models now , and will begin rolling out a fifth , the resurrected Aviator , later this year. But you can sell a car to send a message. "" Cars can still be effective to help represent where a brand is and where it is going. It be a kind of spiritual guide for the brand , even if it is not a sales leader , "" said Karl Brauer , executive publisher for Cox Automotive. The Continental has been a powerful symbol of Lincoln ' s resurgence since the latest generation of the long-running nameplate debuted for the 2017 model year. The vehicle garnered many popular reviews when it first debuted and was widely considered as a sign the brand was returning to its roots in large , plush , American luxury vehicles. "" The Continental signaled that Lincoln was going back to its roots , both in terms of naming and in terms of the expressive styling it had been known for , for so many decades , "" Brauer said ."
32,"Hurricane Florence weakened but far from weak : What to know about storm ' s power Hurricane Florence weakened late Wednesday night to a Category 2 storm. This hurricane , though , is far from weak. Even in downgrading Florence , which is expected to crash into the Carolinas late Thursday night or early Friday , the National Hurricane Center predicted life-threatening storm surge ,  catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding ,  and damaging hurricane-force winds.  Here  s why the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale shouldn  t be the only measure of Florence  s strength : This is a big hurricane Hurricane Florence is bigger than the state of North Carolina and four times larger than Ohio. It would swallow the smaller New England states. As of Wednesday night , Florence  s tropical-storm-force winds were nearly 400 miles wide  or the roughly the equivalent of driving from Washington , D.C , to Charlotte , North Carolina ; or from Milwaukee , Wisconsin to St. Louis ; or from Los Angeles to San Francisco. The hurricane  s immensity is why about 10 million people across North Carolina , South Carolina and Virginia are under storm watches and warnings , with meteorologists projecting Florence could become the most powerful storm to hit this part of the United States in at least 25 years. Harvey-level rain The National Weather Service is predicting excessive  rainfall totals , potentially up to 40 inches in isolated areas , as Florence comes to crawl off the coast of the Carolinas before making landfall somewhere near the border of the two states. From Thursday night through Sunday morning , CNN reported that Florence would travel only 150 miles , or slower than the average walking pace of 2-3 mph. Florence could threaten the largest rainfall event in U.S. history , Hurricane Harvey , the 2017 whirlwind that settled over Texas and dropped more than 60 inches of rain , turning roadways into rivers , destroying homes and buildings and killing nearly 90 people. It was estimated that Harvey dropped the equivalent of 19 trillion to 21 trillion gallons of water in the greater Houston area , or , as The Washington Post reported a year ago , enough water to fill Utah  s Great Salt Lake four times. Monster waves The NHC measured wave heights of up to 83 feet  the equivalent of a seven-story building  as Florence churned in the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday. The waves will meet resistance as Florence approaches landfall , but storm surges up to 13 feet are expected in some areas of North Carolina , according to the weather service. The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds , where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves ,  the NWS report said. The deadliest and most destructive element of any hurricane , the storm surge from Florence could flood tens of thousands of structures , North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. Power outages Duke Energy , a primary power supplier in the Carolinas , already is warning that up to 75 percent of its 4 million customers could lose power  and not just for a few hours. We  re talking about days , potentially weeks ,  Duke Energy spokesman Jeff Brooks said Wednesday night on CNN. Bye-bye Florence ? Not every hurricane has its name retired  and there  s already a buzz that Florence will join the likes of Hazel ( 1954 ) , Hugo ( 1989 ) , Fran ( 1996 ) and Isabel ( 2003 ) , the four most destructive hurricanes to strike the southeastern United States. Names are retired only if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate ,  according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration website. Doesn  t sound like a weak hurricane , does it ?|||||Hurricanes A guide to the world ' s deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas , threatening lives , homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms , fuelled by warm , moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm , sucking air in and upwards , reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h ( 74mph ) , it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. "" Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well , we ' re about to get punched in the face.

34,"Thirty-four people are feared dead after an inferno ripped through a dive boat off the coast of Southern California , trapping dozens of passengers below deck in the dead of night , authorities said. Twenty bodies have been recovered but 14 people are still missing and presumed dead , officials said Tuesday. The Coast Guard will seek to stabilize the scorched boat to recover some of the additional dead. Divers spotted several bodies on the ocean floor. It is never an easy decision to suspend search efforts ,  Coast Guard Captain Monica Rochester said Monday. Five of the six crew members , including the captain , survived. The fire broke out on the 75-foot Conception , owned by Truth Aquatics , around 3 a.m. PST , while it was anchored overnight only about 20 yards off Platts Harbor on Santa Cruz Island , officials said. Escape routes from the boat  s lower two decks were presumably blocked by fire , Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. No one from the third and second decks escaped , he added. Among the presumed dead are students and parents from Pacific Collegiate School in Northern California , its principal said. While this was not a school sponsored trip , our hearts and thoughts are with the families of the victims and those yet missing , particularly those of our students and parents on board ,  the principal said in a statement. Firefighters were still trying to douse the flames hours later when the vessel sank in 60-foot waters.  You can only imagine the tragedy. It  s horrendous. There are some things you can  t unsee   Bob Hansen , who rescued survivors of the dive boat fire Crew members were awake and on the bridge when the flames began to consume the wooden-hulled vessel. Mayday calls captured the chaos at sea. I can ' t breathe ,  one person on the ship reportedly said in a call , according to ABC News. CNN reported that a Coast Guard dispatcher was heard questioning a Conception crew member about firefighting equipment and an escape hatch  for passengers during a mayday call. Can you get back on board and unlock the boat? ... you don  t have any firefighting gear at all ? No fire extinguishers or anything ?  the dispatcher is heard asking. The crew member  s replies were reportedly inaudible. The five crew members fled and were rescued by a pleasure boat moored nearby. Bob Hansen , the owner of Grape Escape , told The Daily Beast that he and his wife were out on the water for the weekend , anchored in a cove on Santa Cruz Island , when they heard pounding. I put on some shorts and walk outside and open the door and here  s five guys in a little rubber boat and a 75-foot commercial boat on fire ,  said Hansen , 73 , from Madera , California. It was really on fire ... the whole thing engulfed in flames. The flames were shooting up 25 feet. I felt so helpless. It  s just burning. There were five tanks that were blowing up  or we thought there were  these big pops.  Hansen brought the five crew members on board ; one had a badly broken leg. He radioed the Coast Guard and waited for them to arrive , watching the scene unfold in horror , before ferrying the crew back to land. You can only imagine the tragedy. It  s horrendous ,  Hansen said. There are some things you can  t unsee.  The Coast Guard struggled to put out the fire  which kept reigniting  before it burned the Conception down to the waterline. Then the flaming hulk sank , leaving its bow pointing out of the water. This is probably the worst case scenario you probably could have ,  Brown said. To be in a remote location , to have a fire , to have minimal firefighting resources , and to have a fire that spreads quickly while most of the passengers are asleep  you can imagine how bad that is.  The missing included one crew members. None of the passenger names were released , and authorities said the bodies that were retrieved would need to be identified through DNA. The Conception came to rest at an unstable angle , complicating the recovery effort. They  re waiting to find the right time to go in and recover those bodies ,  Brown said. Shayna Kreps , who lives in the Bay Area , told The Daily Beast one of her family members was on the trip. She said her family learned of the disaster on the news and had not been able to reach authorities. We ' re angry that we  re unable to get any information ,  she said. The cause of the blaze was unknown , but because it was a diving trip , there could have been air tanks on board exploding and reigniting the flames. The FBI was on the scene and the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a crew to the site. The Coast Guard said the vessel was in complete compliance  and that the owner was cooperating with the operation and investigation. Truth Aquatics  fleet is custom-designed for diving , according to its website , which says the company caters to divers or ocean enthusiasts seeking a stress-free getaway.  A calendar of events on the website indicated a three-day $ 665 Labor Day weekend trip was scheduled and being run by Worldwide Diving Adventures. Divers have the unique opportunity to explore the pinnacles of San Miguel Island ,  World Diving wrote of the trip. The beginning of September is the best time to be at San Mig , which see strong winds and swell during much of the year.  Efforts to reach Truth Aquatics and Worldwide Diving were unsuccessful. But the founder of Truth Aquatics , who has been retired for years , was stunned by the tragedy. I spent 40 years running boats and we never had a fire ... I ' m just flabbergasted ,  Roy Hauser told The Daily Beast , adding that he commissioned the Conception in 1980 and that it had undergone tremendous remodeling  in the last three years. Hauser wondered whether something electrical could have sparked the blaze given that it happened in the dead of night. The galley wouldn  t be open at that hour ... The generator is running all the time. There  d be no cooking activity at 4 o  clock in the morning. The crew only starts getting everything ready at 5 : 30 in the morning . "
35,"The Washington Post has a new slogan on its homepage : "" Democracy Dies in Darkness. "" The motto , one that has been used periodically in the past by Washington Post columnist and editor Bob Woodward , was first spotted on Friday. Post spokesperson Kris Coratti told CNN that readers should expect to see more of it on other platforms of the publication. ADVERTISEMENT "" We thought it would be a good , concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year , "" Coratti said last week. "" We started with our newest readers on Snapchat , and plan to roll it out on our other platforms in the coming weeks. "" Members of other media organizations were seen mocking the new slogan online on Tuesday and Wednesday : I thought people were joking about this new WP motto : "" democracy dies in darkness. "" They were not. I shouldn ' t be laughing so hard.

The 140-year-old paper  s adopted slogan Democracy Dies in Darkness  is now on the website  s homepage underneath the title. Popularized by legendary American investigative journalist Bob Woodward , Washington Post Communications Director Shani George said the alliteration-bent slogan has been internally used by the media organization for years. We thought it would be a good , concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year ,  George told CBS News. George said the slogan was orginally revealed last Friday not in response to President Trump  s freewheeling Thursday afternoon press conference , but instead for the paper  s launching of Snapchat Discover , a Silicon Valley-style reinvention in line with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  vision of building a younger , more mobile readership. Bezos purchased The Washington Post for $ 250 million in 2013. Woodward , who joined CBS  Face the Nation  over the weekend , repeated the slogan in his response to a posed question regarding journalistic integrity and Mr. Trump  s brandish attacks and railings against the media in person and on Twitter. The press is not that enemy. And the concern in the press is that we  ll have secret government. That government does things that we should know about that we don  t ,  Woodward said. And the judge who said it got it right , democracies die in darkness. And so we  re working against the darkness.  The judge that Woodward was referring to is US District Judge Algenon L. Marbley , who questioned an Ohio state attorney about voter suppression tactics during a 2012 court hearing. Shortly after the exchange , the judge  s comments about transparency went viral , especially on progressive news organizations  websites such as The Atlantic and ThinkProgress. So far , the new slogan has not reached the actual front page copy of the paper. But that might change. George said the paper expects to integrate the slogan across different mediums in the upcoming weeks. In past 24 hours , Twitter users across the political spectrum have responded to the slogan in different ways , including some oddball parodies : Look beneath The Post ' s web masthead. "" Democracy dies in darkness. "" For years , that has been a guiding principle for @realBobWoodward.

The fire started at a trash receptacle at an apartment building on 4445 Holden Street around 9 : 30 p.m. The man made it safely to the ground and did not appear to be badly hurt as he walked away. A death-defying escape was captured on video as a man scaled 15 stories down a West Philadelphia high-rise during a fire Thursday night. The fire started at a trash receptacle at an apartment building on 4445 Holden Street around 9 : 30 p.m. , sending smoke throughout the high-rise. Residents were evacuated from the building as firefighters checked the floors to get people out. As SkyForce10 flew over the scene , a man was spotted climbing down outside the building. While it took a little less than three minutes for the man to make his way down to safety , it felt like an eternity for those who watched. "" He climbed about 200 feet down on what looked like basically chain-link fencing and then the railings of each apartment building , "" SkyForce10 pilot Jeremy Haas said. Once the man reached the ground he was greeted by waiting police officers before walking away. He did not appear to be hurt. Residents waited in buses before being let back into their homes after firefighters had extinguished the flames. Four civilians and two police officers were taken to area hospitals for minor smoke inhalation , but all appeared stable , the Philadelphia Fire Department said. Officials have not yet revealed what caused the blaze .|||||EMBED >More News Videos Watch Maggie Kent ' s full interview with the man who scaled West Philadelphia high-rise on July 19 , 2019. EMBED >More News Videos Residents : Man climbing high rise was looking for family : as seen on Action News Morning , July 19 , 2019. PHILADELPHIA ( WPVI ) -- A man seen scaling a West Philadelphia apartment building during a fire spoke exclusively to Action News describing how he would stop at nothing to reach his mother trapped on the 15th floor.Thirty-five-year-old Jermaine has experience scaling walls. He was a roofer , construction worker , and an all-around adventurous child. "" As kids we used to jump roofs , "" he said. "" Glad I had the practice. "" That practice came in handy Thursday night when the 19-story Westpark Apartments high-rise at 4445 Holden Street started filling with smoke.Jermaine got a call from his sister that their mother , 65-year-old Sheila , who is bed-ridden , couldn ' t get out of her 15th floor apartment.He rushed over to the scene. Jermaine first attempted the front door , but it was blocked by police. "" They said the elevators are not working. I said , ' No problem. I ' ll take the steps. I just want to make sure my mother- my mother is sick , she ' s bed-ridden. So I need to get up there , "" Jermaine said. "" They were like ' we can ' t let you in. ' I took it upon myself because that ' s my mother. There ' s no limits. That ' s my mother. "" Earlier that day , Jermaine fell and cracked his hip on a set of stairs. His crutches sat next to him on the couch as he was being interviewed by Action News.Despite his injuries , adrenaline took over. Jermaine started to scale the fenced-in balconies of the building , with wire cutters in hand. He was familiar with the layout of the complex because he had lived there in the past. "" When I grabbed a gate , at the top of the gate , there was a ledge. Then I could step on top of the ledge and reach up to the other gate , and keep climbing my way up , "" Jermaine said.He did anything he could just to get to his mother. "" All for my mom ' s safety , period. I wasn ' t worried about mine at all. She can ' t get out of the bed or walk around so if there ' s a fire she needs help out , "" he said.He made it all the way to his mom ' s balcony. Once there , Shelia saw her son outside her 15th floor apartment and assured him she was doing OK. She told him the fire was contained.Jermaine said his mother did not yell at him for climbing up 15 stories , but , "" She was more shocked. She ' s not surprised by the things that I do for her. She knows I ' ll go over and beyond for her. "" Then just as quickly as he got up , he scaled back down the building. When he got close to ground level , he was sure he ' d be arrested. But an understanding officer let Jermaine go. "" He told me if I didn ' t leave I was going straight to jail. Because that was his job. But , he actually did cut me a break. He understood the circumstances , he knew - when your adrenaline is pumping , and your mom is up there , you thinking she ' s dying - you ' d do anything you can , "" Jermaine said.Jermaine ' s mother made it out safely , as did many residents. Four civilians and three firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.Jermaine said he actually did once apply to be a firefighter. He never heard anything back ."
37,"Woody Allen  s Oscar-winning screenplay for Annie Hall has been voted the funniest ever written , by the Writers Guild of America. The organisation assembled a list of the 101 funniest scripts and announced the awards after panel discussions and clips at an event in Hollywood , presented by Rob Reiner. Allen  s romantic comedy , in which he stars opposite an Oscar-winning Diane Keaton , beat competition from Some Like It Hot , Groundhog Day , Airplane ! and Tootsie , which made up the rest of the top five. The highest-placed new script on the list was Kristen Wiig and Annie Mummolo  s Oscar-nominated Bridesmaids , at number 16. Other newer titles included Borat ( 29 ) , The Hangover ( 30 ) , Shaun of the Dead ( 50 ) , Anchorman ( 54 ) , Wedding Crashers ( 59 ) and Little Miss Sunshine ( 64 ) . The oldest script on the list is 1925  s The Gold Rush ( 94 ) , which was written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. There was also another silent film on the list , 1926  s The General ( 56 ) . As well as Annie Hall , Allen also had six other scripts included : Sleeper , Bananas , Take the Money and Run , Broadway Danny Rose , Love and Death , and Manhattan. The next most featured screenwriter was Harold Ramis with five ( including Ghostbusters and Caddyshack ) followed by Preston Sturges with four ( including The Lady Eve and Sullivan  s Travels ) . The top 20 is as follows :|||||For years there have been rumors of a bootleg cut of an original , much longer version -- titled Anhedonia -- which supposedly was more of a surreal murder mystery than a love story.

The Writers Guild of America , West ( WGAW ) and the Writers Guild of America , East ( WGAE ) released a list Wednesday of the 101 funniest screenplays ever.

38,"The head of the rail company involved in a devastating train derailment and explosion in Quebec defended his decision to wait several days to travel to the scene , saying he was more effective working with his staff in Chicago than he would have been wandering around the disaster site. Edward Burkhardt , head of the Montreal , Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway , says he plans to travel to Lac-Megantic Tuesday to join the dozen or so staff the rail line already has on the ground. "" I made a decision that I would stay back here and try to handle the press , the insurance people , and a host of other relationships that are important to this entire issue , "" Burkhardt told CTV ' s Canada AM. "" I ' ve been working 20 hour days ever since Saturday dealing with this , and I think I can be more effective in my office with a staff than I can be trying to work a cell phone on the edge of the cordoned-off area in Megantic. "" Burkhardt is likely to face some criticism when he does arrive in the Quebec community located about 250 kilometres east of Montreal. The town is still reeling after a train rolled into the town from the community of Nantes , about 13 kilometres away , then derailed and caught fire. The blast overnight Friday killed at least 13 people , and nearly 40 more are still missing. And many have wondered why Burkhardt hasn ' t been present to explain to the media and townspeople what happened. He said Tuesday morning the company is "" not trying to duck out of anything -- we ' re meeting our responsibilities as best we can at this point , "" but acknowledged that not everyone agrees with his choice to wait several days before travelling to Lac-Megantic. "" I am headed there today and that had been my plan. One of the worst things is to be wandering around at the time the first responders are trying to make their emergency rescues in the city , you can do absolutely nothing so I think I made a good decision there although I realize I ' m taking severe criticism from some quarters for it , "" he said. There have been questions about what led up to the horrific accident. A fire crew in Nantes battled a blaze on the train on Friday evening , and Burkhardt claims they shut the train down which could have disengaged its air brakes and sent it rolling down the tracks. "" They shut down the engine that was maintaining the brakes that were holding the train. They didn  t do that on purpose , this was inadvertent , "" Burkhardt said. Nantes fire chief Patrick Lambert told The Canadian Press his crew had been trained by MMA to handle fires on its line , and was following the company ' s own procedures when firefighters shut off the engine to battle the blaze. And once the fire was out , the crew received the all-clear from MMA to depart the scene , Lambert said. However , MMA maintains the crew should have alerted the engineer , who at that point was sleeping in a hotel. After the fire crew left the scene , the train began rolling downhill towards Lac-Megantic. The train was carrying 72 tanker cars full of shale oil from North Dakota , and was destined for an Irving oil refinery in Saint John , N.B ."

40,"The effect of several organic acids on plant drought tolerance after 14 days. From left to right , water , HCl , formic acid , acetic acid , butyric acid , lactic acid , citric acid. Note , only plants treated with acetic acid survived. Credit : RIKEN Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science ( CSRS ) have discovered a new , yet simple , way to increase drought tolerance in a wide range of plants. Published in Nature Plants , the study reports a newly discovered biological pathway that is activated in times of drought. By working out the details of this pathway , scientists were able to induce greater tolerance for drought-like conditions simply by growing plants in vinegar. Led by Jong-Myong Kim and Motoaki Seki at RIKEN CSRS , the large collaborative effort began with the discovery of novel Arabidopsis mutants that have strong drought tolerance , although the reasons were unknown. These plants have a mutation to an enzyme called HDA6 ( histone deacetylase6 ) , and the first goal of the current study was to determine exactly how this mutation allows the plants to grow normally in severe and extended conditions without water. Kim and Seki say that this project has led to several important discoveries. Not only did they discover that external application of vinegar can enhance drought tolerance in the Arabidopsis plant , but they also found that this pathway is regulated epigenetically and conserved in common crops such as maize , rice , and wheat. Initial testing in normal Arabidopsis under drought stress showed that genomic-wide expression of hda6 was linked to activation of the biological pathway that produces acetate , the main component of vinegar. In the mutated plants , they found that under the same conditions , this pathway was activated even more , and plants produced larger amounts of acetate. Further analysis showed that activity of the HDA6 enzyme acts as a switch that controls which type of metabolic pathway is active. Normally plants break down sugar for energy , but in time of drought , they switch to the acetate-producing pathway. The team next measured acetate levels in normal plants and found that the amount of acetate produced by plants during drought directly correlated to how well they survived. To confirm this , they tested plants with mutations in two of the genes found in the acetate-biosynthesis pathway. Results showed that these plants produced less acetate and were more sensitive to drought than normal plants. These results predicted that increasing the amount of acetate in plants could help them survive drought. The team tested this hypothesis by growing normal plants in drought conditions and treatment with acetic acid , other organic acids , or water. They found that after 14 days over 70 % of the plants treated with acetic acid had survived , while virtually all other plants had died. The scientists mapped the entire signaling pathway from the HDA6 switch , and realized that this pathway is highly conserved across different plant species. They performed the same experiment as described above , and found that drought tolerance also increased in rice , wheat , and maize when the plants were grown in optimal acetic acid concentrations. Kim notes the significance of this finding. "" Although transgenic technologies can be used to create plants that are more tolerant to drought , we must also develop simple and less expensive technologies because genetically modified plants are not available in all several countries. We expect that external application of acetate to plants will be a useful , simple , and less expensive way to enhance drought tolerance in a variety of plants.

41,"Rescue crews have recovered the body of a 30-year-old woman swept away by fast-moving water Saturday evening in Pennypack Park in Northeast Philadelphia. Philadelphia police said the marine unit made the discovery at 10 a.m. in Pennypack Creek , upstream from Frankford Avenue. The woman , identified by friends on Facebook as photographer Rebecca Bunting , reportedly was taking photographs in a storm drain when she was swept into the creek by a sudden rush of water.nto the water shortly before 6 : 45 p.m. Saturday. When she did not emerge , her boyfriend made a frantic 911 call , and police in the 15th District dispatched a marine unit to the area of Sandyford and Ryan Avenues. The area is near Sandy Run , which flows into Pennypack Creek. The drowning is a troubling part of summer in this region of many rivers , creeks and lakes. Last weekend , two bodies from separate incidents were recovered from the Delaware River. Last month , a 12-year-old boy drowned in Burlington County ' s Sylvan Lake. Nearby residents have said Pennypack Creek is notoriously dangerous , particularly after rain. Before this incident , at least five people  ranging in age from 13 to 67  had been found dead in Pennypack Creek since 2010 , and the creek was rain-swollen in four of those cases. Elsie Stevens , corresponding secretary with the Holme Circle Civic Association , partnered with city officials in 2014 to hold a series of school assemblies meant to educate teenagers in the area about the perils of swimming in the creek , whether it ' s facing surging waters or dangerous bacteria. Stevens , 70 , has lived a short walk away from Pennypack Park for 47 years  but , she warned , there ' s a "" dark side "" to the creek. "" Pennypack can be beautiful and serene and great for pictures , but after a rainstorm , it can be deadly , "" she said. "" The water just rages down the creek .

The 30-year-old photographer and her boyfriend were inside a storm drain just before 6 p.m. Saturday when they were knocked into the creek. Bunting  s boyfriend managed to pull himself out of 10-feet of water and called for help. Divers arrived at the scene and frantically searched for Bunting , but with no luck.

42,"The number of dead trees in California  s drought-stricken forests has risen dramatically to more than 102 million in what officials described as an unparalleled ecological disaster that heightens the danger of massive wildfires and damaging erosion. Officials said they were alarmed by the increase in dead trees , which they estimated to have risen by 36 million since the government  s last survey in May. The U.S. Forest Service , which performs such surveys of forest land , said Friday that 62 million trees have died this year alone. The scale of die-off in California is unprecedented in our modern history ,  said Randy Moore , the forester for the region of the U.S. Forest Service that includes California. Trees are dying at a rate much quicker than we thought.  Scientists say five years of drought are to blame for much of the destruction. The lack of rain has put California  s trees under considerable stress , making them more susceptible to the organisms , such as beetles , that can kill them. Unusually high temperatures have added to the trees  demand for water , exacerbating an already grim situation. Advertisement The majority of the dead trees are in the southern and central Sierra Nevada region , officials said , though they warned that high mortality levels are also creeping into forests in Northern California , notably Siskiyou , Modoc , Plumas and Lassen counties. Adrian Das , an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey , needs only to step outside his office in Sequoia National Park to see the extent of the damage. You look across the hillside on a side of the road , and you see a vast landscape of dead trees ,  he said. It  s pretty startling.  Das said the parts of the forest at lower elevations  about 5,000 to 6,000 feet  continue to get hit the hardest. In the higher elevations , it can sometimes appear as if there is no drought and the trees are much healthier. We have sugar pines here  grand trees that can live for 500 years ,  he said. Everywhere you walk , through certain parts of these forests , at least half of these big guys are dead.  Although California enjoyed a wet start to the water year in Northern California , the central and southern parts of the state remain locked in what federal officials classify as extreme  and exceptional  drought. This staggering and growing number of tree deaths should be concerning for everyone ,  said Max Gomberg , the climate and conservation manager at the State Water Resources Control Board. It helps us realize just how intense and extreme this drought has been  particularly for Central and Southern California.  A single year of average precipitation , which parts of the state got last year , would not end the drought or cause trees to stop dying , experts said. Even with a historic deluge this winter , Moore said , die-off would continue for at least a year or two. Dead trees create various hazards for Californians. For example , such trees are weak and can fall more easily than healthy trees. In October 2015 , Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency and formed a tree-mortality task force to help mobilize additional resources for the safe removal of fallen and dying trees.  In May 2016 , an aerial survey of was conducted in Placerville , near the Sacramento area. Meanwhile , the U.S. Forest Service has reallocated $ 43 million in California this fiscal year to conduct safety-focused restoration along roads , trails and recreation sites ,  the agency said in a statement. Then there is the wildfire danger. California was struck this summer by a series of deadly wildfires that destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee. Officials at the time said some of those fires were fueled by dead trees. When a lot of dead fuel remains on the ground , fires burn hotter and damage the soil , experts said. Whenever rain eventually arrives , the water cannot filter through the soil as easily , so it moves the top layer , creating the potential for mudslides and destroying root systems. Like a sheet of glass ,  said Scott McLean , a battalion chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Where  s that water going to go ? Quickly downhill.  Once fires burn through the fuel on the ground , they can climb up a ladder  of dry branches and timber until they get into the crown of the tree , McLean said. And once a fire gets to the top of a tree , it can spread quickly  hopping from tree to tree rather than winding more slowly across the ground. The forest service said longer , hotter fire seasons are likely to continue for years to come. Officials said this and increased development in forested areas is driving up the cost of fighting fires. Some experts , however , have questioned whether there  s a correlation between high levels of dead trees and fire severity. Officials say that fire management consumed more than half of the Forest Service  s budget last year. A blaze in Monterey County this summer burned for months , making it one of the costliest fires to fight in U.S. Forest Service history. These dead and dying trees continue to elevate the risk of wildfire , complicate our efforts to respond safely and effectively to fires when they do occur , and pose a host of threats to life and property across California ,  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. matt.stevens@latimes.com ALSO Man pleads not guilty to vandalizing Trump  s Walk of Fame star Border Patrol union welcomes Trump  s proposed wall as a vital tool  Los Angeles couple reported missing during camping trip found safe in Mexico , police say|||||California  s lingering drought has pushed the number of dead trees across the state past 100 million , an ecological event experts are calling dangerous and unprecedented in underlining the heightened risk of wildfires fueled by bone-dry forests. In its latest aerial survey released Friday , the U.S. Forest Service said 62 million trees have died this year in California , bringing the six-year total to more than 102 million. Scientists blame five-plus years of drought on the increasing tree deaths  tree fatalities  increased by 100 percent in 2016  but the rate of their demise has been much faster than expected , increasing the risk of ecologically damaging erosion and wildfires even bigger than the largest blazes the state  s seen this year. It  s not beyond the pale to suggest that this is a pretty unprecedented event in at least recent history ,  said Adrian Das , an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. There are about 21 million acres of trees spread across California  s 18 national forests , and the latest figures show 7.7 million of them  more than one-third  are dead. The U.S. Forest Service has earmarked $ 43 million in California to help restore eroded sections of roads and trails throughout the state  s wooded areas , but officials say too much money is being spent on fighting wildfires that are becoming more and more common , as opposed to restoring the scarred forests. It  s been a record-setting year for those wildfires , which have burned through 56 percent of the U.S. Forest Service  s budget , leading U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to petition Congress to classify wildfires as disasters , which would free up additional federal funding to fight them. "" These dead and dying trees continue to elevate the risk of wildfire , complicate our efforts to respond safely and effectively to fires when they do occur , and pose a host of threats to life and property across California ,  Vilsack said in a statement. The majority of the 102 million dead trees are in the southern and central Sierra Nevada region , the survey found , but the Forest Service also warned of tree deaths on the rise in northern regions , especially in Siskiyou , Modoc , Plumas and Lassen counties. Rising temperatures throughout the state aren  t helping matters , and neither are the persevering infestations of bark beetles fond of gnawing through pine trees stressed by drought , leaving in their wake thousands of acres of brown , dead wood. From his base in Sequoia National Park , Das said pines are dying faster than firs , but all the acres of trees he studies have been drying out and falling over faster than they should. Tree mortality , and what drives it , is still a poorly understood process ,  Das said , adding that one of few immediate upsides to the stands of dying trees is that scientists can better study what specifically is causing their demise. The old-growth forests he studies  resplendent with massive sequoia trees and sugar pines that often live for centuries  are changing more rapidly than he has ever seen , a matter of months in what usually unfolds over years or decades. You want to understand what  s going on in these systems , and you should be concerned when big changes are happening and you don  t really have a handle on what the mechanisms are and how they  ll play out ,  Das said.

Approximately 36 million of those deaths have come since the US Forestry Service last surveyed the forests in May. And the number of dead trees in the Golden State doubled over the past year. The tree deaths are changing the California landscape , particularly at lower elevations. They  re also raising questions about the best ways to protect people from falling trees or wildfires while preserving forests. California has endured a drought for the past five years. The lack of precipitation has left trees struggling to get enough water and prone to infestation by bark beetles. This year started off wet in Northern California , but the southern and central parts of the state continued to struggle with what officials termed extreme  and exceptional  drought. Even if historic levels of precipitation blanket the state this winter , trees will continue to die off well into 2017 and even 2018 , say forestry officials. Dead trees pose a number of challenges , which California and the federal government are working to address. The dying trees amplify the threat of wildfires. This summer , thousands of residents were forced to evacuate as wildfires raged , and hundreds of homes were destroyed. With so much dead wood still standing in forests , fires spread rapidly. The flames can climb trees and even spread between the tops of trees , which is making fighting fires more costly. These dead and dying trees continue to elevate the risk of wildfire , complicate our efforts to respond safely and effectively to fires when they do occur , and pose a host of threats to life and property across California ,  US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. The dead , falling trees also create hazards for people walking along trails and through national parks. In October 2015 , California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in order to amass the funds needed to safely remove fallen and dying trees from areas where people work and relax. The US Forestry Service likewise reallocated $ 43 million of its California budget for safety-focused restoration along roads , trails , and recreation sites.  Many say that getting the dead trees out of the forests is the answer. Officials have suggested turning the trees into lumber or burning them for electricity. Experts have suggested that having too much dead wood on the forest floor can actually damage the soil when wildfires do happen , since fires have too much fuel and therefore burn at very high temperatures. But some environmentalists have advocated for leaving the trees in the forests , saying it  s part of the life-cycle of a forest for dead wood to decompose and provide wildlife habitat on the forest floor. Longer-term forest management may help prevent excessive tree deaths and out-of-control wildfires. In his statement , Secretary Vilsack called for Congress to shift the balance of money it allocates , allotting less to putting out fires and more to preventing fires. Ironically , the answer to the dead trees and rampant wildfires may be more fires. According to forest ecologist Chad Hanson at Earth Island Institute  s John Muir Project , fire suppression efforts since California was settled have created unnaturally green and dense forests.

In Saluda , 25 miles to the south , the faithful drove home from church at noon with their headlights on. In Macon County , near another vast blaze , authorities distributed health masks. So thick was the gloom shrouding the region that it looked as though winter  s first big snow was about to tumble. But it was just smoke , as every nose in a thousand square miles could tell , and there was no hint of a much-needed soaking in the forecast.

44,"A magnitude 4.5 earthquake was reported late Friday night , rattling a wide swath of Southern California but causing no major damage. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries , but the 11 : 38 p.m. quake was felt across the region and as far as San Diego , according to the U.S. Geological Survey , which revised its magnitude downward after initial reports. It was followed by a few smaller aftershocks. In South Pasadena , about 10 miles from the epicenter , the quake began with a strong sharp shake followed by another jolt not quite as strong. Several items fell off a shelf in one home. But power remained on. The shaking was less severe farther from the epicenter but still packed a punch. The temblor was centered not far from the epicenter of the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake , seismologist Lucy Jones said on Twitter. That quake was much larger  at 5.9 magnitude  and caused several deaths and more than $ 200 million in damage. Advertisement Yes. A M4.6 2 mi WSW of El Monte at 11 : 38. Almost the same location as the M5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake in 1987  Dr. Lucy Jones ( @DrLucyJones ) September 19 , 2020 The Whittier Narrows area is seismically active. In 2014 , a magnitude 5.1 earthquake struck along the Puente Hills thrust fault , which stretches from the San Gabriel Valley to downtown Los Angeles. That quake , centered near La Habra , caused some damage and left about 100 residents temporarily displaced. The Puente Hills thrust fault is considered particularly dangerous because it runs under the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles. Experts say a major , magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the fault could do more damage to the heart of Los Angeles than the dreaded Big One on the San Andreas fault , which runs along the outskirts of metropolitan Southern California. Molly Oswaks was sitting in her Koreatown apartment on the phone with her 12-step sponsor when the couch started swaying.

As the framed art above her rattled on the wall , the 31-year-old freelance writer freaked out in real time  while processing it on the phone with her sponsor , who was not in the city at the time. Their conversation had already been as L.A. as it gets  before the ground started shaking , she said. And then the most L.A. event  more so even than a movie premiere  happened ,  Oswaks said , referring to the earthquake. The temblor didn  t cause any damage in Oswaks  studio apartment , though a sample vial of Black Orchid by Tom Ford perfume fell off the dresser. And as for the 12-step advice she was working on ? Oswaks said that after the shaking stopped she felt present in her body to an uncomfortable degree.  Careful what you wish for.  The earthquake occurred less than a mile from South San Gabriel , less than a mile from Montebello , less than a mile from South El Monte and 1 mile from San Gabriel. In the last 10 days , there has been one earthquake of magnitude 3.0 or greater centered nearby. An average of five earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.0 and 5.0 occur per year in the Greater Los Angeles area , according to a recent three-year data sample.

47,"A giant cloud of ash and gases released by Vesuvius in 79 AD took about 15 minutes to kill the inhabitants of Pompeii , research suggests. The estimated 2,000 people who died in the ancient Roman city when they could not escape were not overwhelmed by the lava , but rather asphyxiated by the gases and ashes and later covered in volcanic debris to leave a mark of their physical presence millennia later. The study by researchers from the Department of Earth and Geo-environmental Sciences of the University of Bari , in collaboration with the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology ( INGV ) and the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh , has revealed the duration of the so-called pyroclastic flow , a dense , fast-moving flow of solidified lava pieces , volcanic ash and hot gases that hit the ancient Roman city minutes after the volcano erupted. The lethal cloud had a temperature of over 100 degrees and was composed of CO2 , chlorides , particles of incandescent ash and volcanic glass  , said Roberto Isaia , senior researcher of the Vesuvius Observatory of the INGV. The aim of the work was to develop a model to try to understand and quantify the impact of pyroclastic flows on the inhabited area of Pompeii , about 10km [ 6 miles ] from Vesuvius ,  he added. The study confirms that the inhabitants had no escape , and most of those who died suffocated in their homes and beds , or in the streets and squares of the city. Isaia  s model estimates the gases , ash and volcanic particles would have engulfed the city for between 10 and 20 minutes. It is probable that dozens of people died due to the rain of lapilli that fell on Pompeii after the eruption , but most of them died of asphyxiation ,  Isaia said , adding the pyroclastic flow would have reached Pompeii a few minutes after the explosion. Those 15 minutes inside that infernal cloud must have been interminable. The inhabitants could not have imagined what was happening. The Pompeiians lived with earthquakes , but not with eruptions , so they were taken by surprise and swept away by that incandescent cloud of ash.  The INGV research described pyroclastic flows as the most devastating impact  of explosive eruptions. Comparable to avalanches , they are generated by the collapse of the eruptive column. The resulting volcanic ashes run along the slopes of the volcano at speeds of hundreds of kilometres per hour , at high temperatures and with a high concentration of particles.  Today , the ruins of Pompeii are Italy  s second-most visited archaeological site , after the Colosseum in Rome and , last year , attracted about a million tourists. It is very important to be able to reconstruct what happened during Vesuvius  s past eruptions , starting from the geological record , in order to trace the characteristics of the pyroclastic currents and the impact on population ,  said Prof Pierfrancesco Dellino of the University of Bari. The adopted scientific approach in this study reveals information that is contained in the pyroclastic deposits and that clarifies new aspects of the eruption of Pompeii and provides valuable insights for interpreting the behaviour of Vesuvius , also in terms of civil protection . |||||Officials at the Pompeii archaeological site in Italy announced Saturday the discovery of an intact ceremonial chariot , the AP reports , one of several important discoveries made in the same area outside the park near Naples following an investigation into an illegal dig. The chariot , with its iron elements , bronze decorations and mineralized wooden remains , was found in the ruins of a settlement north of Pompeii , beyond the walls of the ancient city , parked in the portico of a stable where the remains of three horses previously were discovered. The Archaeological Park of Pompeii called the chariot an exceptional discovery  and said "" it represents a unique find , which has no parallel in Italy thus far , in an excellent state of preservation.  The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD destroyed Pompeii. story continues below The chariot was spared when the walls and roof of the structure it was in collapsed , and also survived looting by modern-day antiquities thieves , who had dug tunnels through to the site , grazing but not damaging the four-wheeled cart , according to park officials. The chariot was found on the grounds of what is one of the most significant ancient villas in the area around Vesuvius , with a panoramic view of the Mediterranean Sea. on the outskirts of the ancient Roman city. The chariot ' s first iron element emerged on Jan. 7 from the blanket of volcanic material filling the two-story portico. Archaeologists believe the cart was used for festivities and parades , perhaps also to carry brides to their new homes. While chariots for daily life or the transport of agricultural products have been previously found at Pompeii , officials said the new find is the first ceremonial chariot unearthed in its entirety.

So perhaps it  s unsurprising that the film  s producers , which include Jack Ma  s Alibaba Pictures , decided to take desperate action after the movie opened to just $ 7.1 million over the weekend. Late Sunday evening in Beijing , Asuras official social media accounts posted a simple statement saying that the film would be pulled from cinemas as of 10 p.m. local time. After landing in theaters with limited fanfare , China  s priciest picture ever would vanish from the scene entirely. Asura is co-produced by Zhenjian Film Studio and Ningxia Film Group  two of the investors behind the successful Painted Skin fantasy franchise  along with Alibaba Pictures Group and other minority investors. The statement announcing Asuras retreat from cinemas supplied no explanation for the unprecedented move. But a representative from Zhenjian Film , which is credited as lead producer , later told Chinese news site Sina : This decision was made not only because of the bad box office. We plan to make some changes to the film and release it again.  A spokesperson for the film declined to comment when contacted by THR on Monday. The producers had hoped that Asura would serve as the kickoff to a major fantasy franchise  a property akin to China  s own Lord of the Rings. The film is an original dramatization of ancient Tibetan mythology , with a vast set of characters occupying different heavenly realms. Teenage heartthrob Lei Wu plays the film  s hero , a young boy who must embark on an epic journey to save Asura , a godly dimension of pure desire , after it is threatened by a coup from a lower kingdom. Veteran Hong Kong actors Tony Ka Fai Leung and Carina Lau also star as mythical demigods. Some in the Chinese industry have expressed skepticism over Asuras purported $ 113 million budget  most of China  s biggest blockbusters , such as Wolf Warrior 2 ( $ 870 ) , have been made for about half that much  but it  s clear that the film  s backers spent heavily on foreign production talent and lavish visual effects. The film  s costumes were designed by Oscar-winner Ngila Dickson ( Lord of the Rings ) , while Hollywood veteran Martn Hernandez served as audio director ( The Revenant , Birdman ) and Charlie Iturriaga ( Deadpool , Furious 7 ) supervised the VFX work. The film is the directorial debut of Hollywood stunt coordinator-turned-filmmaker Peng Zhang ( Rush Hour 3 , Twilight 1 &amp; 2 ) . Adding a layer of intrigue to the saga , Asuras backers are now alleging sabotage. Some 90 percent of all Chinese movie tickets are bought online and two mobile ticketing platforms currently dominate the market , Alibaba-owned Tiao Piao Piao and Maoyan , partially backed by Tencent. Both services supply average user review scores for every film on release  numbers that have the same controversial power as Rotten Tomatoes  tomatometer ratings  or Metacritic  s metascores  in North America. A third influential Chinese review aggregator , Douban.com , operates independently of the ticketing services and is known to attract a more discerning , sometimes snarky , reviewer community. Just as trolls have occasionally gamed Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the U.S. , Chinese studios have sometimes alleged that their scores were unfairly hurt by fake negative reviews  or that the competition was boosted by purchased positive ones. Such ghostwriters for hire are known in China as shuijun ,  a pejorative term that literally means water army ,  because companies pay them to flood  forums with fake reviews. Asuras producers are now alleging that they were targeted by a particularly aggressive water army  attack. In a second social media post , they say they discovered a large number of 1/10 reviews for Asura posted to Maoyan by suspicious accounts immediately after the film  s release. Describing the episode as the shame of the industry ,  they say a sizable discrepancy soon emerged between Asuras early average scores on Maoyan ( 4.9/10 ) and on Alibaba  s Tiao Piao Piao ( 8.4/10 ) . The statement concludes with a series of pointed statements directed at Maoyan , questioning the integrity of the platform  s rating system and asking when the company will take action to address such problems. The post also ends with some disparaging words for the shadowy , unknown perpetrators of the campaign , saying that whoever is behind this is dirty , stupid and ridiculous.  Asuras disastrously small debut may be the result of more important factors than a temporary rigging of Maoyan  s ratings , however ( After all , the ticketing service is usually estimated to have a market share of less than 40 percent ) . A more obvious explanation could be that the film opened against uncommonly strong competition. During the same frame that Asura debuted to just $ 7.1 million , holdover blockbuster Dying to Survive added $ 69 million for an 11-day total of $ 366 million , while veteran actor-director Jiang Wen  s much anticipated period action movie Hidden Man opened to a healthy $ 46.2 million. Both films also have been critical favorites : Dying to Survive ranks at 8.9/10 or higher across all Chinese platforms , while Hidden Man has an average score of about 7.4/10. The available tracking data also suggests that the usual makers of a bomb  low audience interest , weak marketing  also probably played a part. Based on our tracking , prerelease market heat for this movie was quite low  below average ,  a representative for Beijing-based market research firm Fankink told THR Monday. Asura  s score on Maoyan also moderated to 6.4/10 as the weekend progressed , while its rating on Alibaba  s Tao Piaopiao dropped to 7.1/10 by Sunday. If Maoyan  s score started unfairly low , Tao Piao Piao  s may have been initially inflated ( both ticketing services have since pulled Asuras scores , since the film is no longer on release ) . Meanwhile , on Douban , Asura has held to the uncommonly low score of 3.1/10. Fair play or the work of a water army ? The Internet in China will soon have its say ."

50,"Police said they  d searched bushland where a man mysteriously vanished. But 18 agonising months later , he was found in the same spot. After Darrell Simon set off on his usual morning bike ride from his partner  s bushland home in November 2014 , there was an excruciating wait for answers which lasted more than 18 months. It was a time when those close to the 46-year-old from Laidley , between Brisbane and Toowoomba , just wanted to know what happened to him. Instead some of those who knew him were subject to hurtful and defamatory speculation as the hunt for his body lingered on for 18 months. To add insult to injury , his body was eventually discovered in an area police had marked down as searched  . Darrell Simon pictured several years before he vanished. Picture : Michelle Smith According to a new coroner  s report into his death , the disappearance out of character and led police and his family to believe he had met with foul play  perhaps due to his financial problems. But , this was not the case. About a week after he vanished , police carried out a search 20km from his girlfriend  s house where he was last seen. The searchers were given a printed copy of a Google Maps image to find the body. But the paper printouts didn  t show the property boundary and , as a result , only half of the block was searched by State Emergency Service crews. They found nothing and it was not until a year later , when water levels in the dense bushland dropped and exposed Mr Simon  s mountain bike in a dam , that the search began again. And it was still another three months after that , on May 21 , that property owners found his remains beneath a tree , 70m from the dam. Police had used printouts from a Google Maps image in the search for Mr Simon. The coroner hit out at the decision to rely on Google Maps printouts in the manhunt  noting that Queensland Police Service ( QPS ) had better tools available to them to search the area. In fact , the inquest detailed how officers on the case were later given a much more informative aerial map of the area from the local council , at no cost to police whatsoever. It is quite apparent the quality of the images of the property on this map is far superior to the Google map images used in the search of the property and one wonders if the same mistake in conducting a search of only half the property would have been made if this map had been obtained ,  Deputy State Coroner John Lock said in his report. The coroner was critical of how this affected those who knew Mr Simon  who was found to have taken his own life due to financial stress. However , the coroner said the fact that Mr Simon  s remains had been missing for so long had fed speculation. Mr Simon  s father , Lawrence Simon  who remained very involved in the search for his missing son and in advocating for him to be found  believed his son  s death may be suspicious and that he may have been harmed by someone else , possibly in a dispute over money. Only half the property where Mr Simon was found was searched. Picture : Coroners Court of Queensland One wonders if Darrell  s body was found during the first police search on 23 November 2014 , whether such unhelpful and at times clearly defamatory and untruthful speculation would have even surfaced ,  the coroners report read. The fact the ground search was conducted over only half the property was very regretful and should not have happened.  He recommended QPS officers be given further training and resources to allow them to properly co-ordinate and conduct land searches  meaning police will be forced to use high-resolution mapping and GPS systems in future searches. He said there should also be improvements in communication with the SES to ensure accuracy. ( I recommend ) that QPS considers the adequacy of resources , information and training currently provided to its officers for the purpose of co-ordinating and conducting land searches to ensure officers are able to and do in fact access high-quality map products and GPS tracking data in a timely way. While not prescribing how QPS might ensure officers take these steps in the future , an example may be to implement some type of quality assurance checklist that officers are required to complete as they go.  Police have advised the coroner it is taking steps to improve its procedures. QPS has already implemented a mandatory task sheet system  for every search and integrated search training between police officers and SES volunteers.

Negligence on the part of hospital authorities has been blamed for the Saturday night fire , which initial reports suggest was caused when an oxygen cylinder exploded in the ward of Ibn al-Khatib hospital. Iraq ' s prime minister fired key hospital officials hours after the catastrophic incident. Among the dead were at least 28 patients on ventilators battling severe symptoms of the virus , tweeted Ali al-Bayati , a spokesman of the country ' s independent Human Rights Commission. The commission is a semi-official body. Firefighters rushed to battle the flames that raged across the second floor of the hospital. Civil defense teams put out flames until the early hours of the morning. Ambulances transported dozens of wounded. The Health Ministry said at least 200 people were rescued from the scene. People look on at Ibn Khatib hospital after a fire caused by an oxygen tank explosion in Baghdad , Iraq , April 25 , 2021. THAIER AL-SUDANI / REUTERS Doctors at the scene were frazzled by the chaos unfolding around them. They said numerous burned bodies were carried out by paramedics from the hospital floor. By midday Sunday , relatives were still searching anxiously for unaccounted for loved ones. "" Please , two of my relatives are missing. ... I am going to die ( without news about them ) , "" posted a young woman on social media after a fruitless search for her family members. "" I hope someone can help us find Sadi Abdul Kareem and Samir Abdul Kareem , they were in the ICU. "" The fire came as Iraq grapples with a severe second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Daily virus cases now average around 8,000 , the highest since Iraq began recording infection rates early last year. At least 15,200 people have died of coronavirus in Iraq among a total of at least 100,000 confirmed cases. In response to the fire , Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi fired the director-general of the Baghdad Health Department in the al-Rusafa area , where the hospital is located. He also fired the director of Ibh al-Khatib Hospital and its director of engineering and maintenance , according to a statement from the Health Ministry and his office. After the fire first broke out , Al-Khadhimi held an emergency meeting at the headquarters of the Baghdad Operations Command , which coordinates Iraqi security forces , according to a statement on his Twitter account. In the meeting he said the incident amounted to negligence. "" Negligence in such matters is not a mistake , but a crime for which all negligent parties must bear responsibility , "" he said. He gave Iraqi authorities 24 hours to present the results of an investigation. U.N. envoy to Iraq Jeannine Hennis-Plasschaert expressed "" shock and pain "" over the incident in a statement and called for stronger protection measures in hospitals ."
52,"The Afghan IT sector , one of the few success stories from the war-ravaged nation , now threatened by continued conflict. Kabul , Afghanistan  When 30-year-old Ali Atayee enrolled for his first computer lessons as an Afghan refugee child growing up in Iran , he knew then this is what he would like to pursue as a career in his adult life. When he returned to Afghanistan in the years that followed , with that one goal in mind , Atayee directed all his energy , time and resources to learning computer science , particularly web development. A graduate of Kabul  s prestigious American University of Afghanistan , Atayee has worked with many growing Information Technology ( IT ) businesses and development projects in the small , yet thriving IT sector in the country. Over the last couple of years , Atayee has moved to working as a freelance web developer for local companies. I had a passion for computer programming but also seeing how the situation was improving in Afghanistan back then , I speculated there would be a lot more development and opportunities in the sector by the time I had graduated ,  he told Al Jazeera. As more and more Afghans came online  12.8 million Afghan internet users as of 2021  the industry flourished over the last 20 years. A USAID report in 2012 noted that the telecommunications field had become one of the largest revenue-generating sectors in Afghanistan with an annual average revenue of $ 139.6m , accounting for more than 12 percent of the total government revenues. The IT sector in Afghanistan was deemed one of the few success stories of the war-ravaged nation by many experts. It was one industry where the public and private sector have been able to build a partnership to provide services to Afghans , while generating revenues for the government and private companies ,  Mohammad Najeeb Azizi , former chairman of Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority ( ATRA ) , told Al Jazeera. Ali Atayee working on his laptop during one of the power blackouts in Kabul [ Ruchi Kumar/Al Jazeera ] However , this potential is quickly ebbing away as the conflict in Afghanistan worsens , with the United States-led forces leaving the country and Taliban regaining a foothold in a nation it once ruled with an iron fist. As the Taliban makes sweeping gains across the country in the last two months , Afghanistan  s IT and other basic infrastructure have come under frequent attack. On July 5 , Taliban fighters blew up fibre optic devices and system equipment in Herat province  s Islam Qala , a border city with Iran and an important trading port. Islam Qala is also a migrant crossing where a number of international NGOs operate , working with thousands of deported refugees daily. The Taliban attack has left the residents in the city without internet connectivity. Last month , the ATRA reported that 28 telecommunication antennas were destroyed across the country in the last three months , while another 23 were partially damaged due to the ongoing conflict , seriously affecting digital and mobile communication services in the country. Simultaneously , the impoverished nation  s electricity infrastructure was also taken out , making the power supply extremely erratic even in capital Kabul. In the last six months , 39 electricity pylons that bring imported power into Afghanistan have been damaged ,  Sangar Niazi , the spokesman of Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat ( DABS ) , the country  s national power supplier , told Al Jazeera. Afghanistan imports nearly 70 percent of the 1,600 megawatts of its electricity needs from neighbouring countries through these pylons. Some were completely destroyed while others were partially damaged , affecting power supply to Kunduz , Baghlan , Kabul , Nangarhar and Parwan provinces ,  Niazi said. Afghan workers fixing a destroyed pylon [ Courtesy of Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat ] While Niazi did not share who the attackers were , the Afghan government has frequently blamed the Taliban for the infrastructural destruction. Millions of Afghans have become intimately familiar with regular power cuts and being forced to navigate daily tasks and chores with just a few hours of electricity supply. However , the lack of electricity has badly hit the country  s small IT sector , particularly for young professionals like Atayee. People in Kabul get only a few hours of electricity per day , some not even an hour , which is only enough to charge your devices and it gets cut again ,  he said to highlight the challenges of delivering work amid the power and internet cuts. As a freelance web developer , Atayee has struggled to meet deadlines on his ongoing project. I have barely been able to get any work done lately , and all my tasks are piling up. The other day , my laptop charger got fired due to the unstable electric currents. It not only slows down my work , but also creates a problem for the clients who are trying to launch a website for their new business ,  he told Al Jazeera. If I don  t deliver on time , I lose clients.  Atayee said a lack of proper infrastructure has also discouraged Afghan businesses from going online. They are hesitant to bring their business online or use technology to their advantage. It impacts both the customers and the professionals in the field ,  he said. We are so behind in the use of technology compared to other countries. We should have at least had online payment capability by now.  Many businesses in Kabul  s IT sector have bought large power generators and invested in proper electricity backup to ensure continued supply. But the costs eat into their profits. For smaller businesses and freelancers such as Atayee , it also means the opportunities of work that previously seemed abundant are no longer lucrative. When the infrastructure is not ideal , business won  t invest in the online space. As a result , there are fewer tech-related jobs. So many people who study this as a major are working in other fields ,  he said. Afghanistan  s business experts warn that if the conflict continues at the same pace , the additional infrastructure costs and risks will discourage new investments. When warring factions shut down services , it affects the revenue generation of these companies and makes it difficult for them to justify the costs. It could lead to a decision to proactively shut down sites or reduce investment on its upkeep , depriving locals of these essential services ,  ATRA ex-chairman Azizi said. It is not only the private businesses affected financially by the Taliban attacks on IT and electricity infrastructure. DABS spokesman Niazi told Al Jazeera the cost of repairing the power pylons has been mounting , putting pressure on the government treasury. If one pylon is completed destroyed , it costs around $ 100,000 to get it back up. Other smaller damages incur costs anywhere between $ 500 to $ 5,000 ,  he said , adding that Afghanistan  s national electric company has spent close to $ 1m only in the last six months. According to Azizi , it is the regular citizens who are most affected by the infrastructure damages. Afghans use communication services not only to improve their lives but to remain in contact with their loved ones in such critical times ,  he said. Telecom is a public service infrastructure and a basic need of the Afghan public.  Azizi appealed to the fighting factions to protect essential services which are not only used by ordinary citizens but also by the warring parties  . Niazi said the Taliban attackers were the enemies of light  , who are turning an essential infrastructure into another casualty of war. It is an attempt to not only push the country into physical darkness , but also intellectual darkness . "
53,"A trio of explorers on the hunt for sunken ships managed to solve a six-decade-old mystery  involving a plane. The group uncovered a US Air Force C-45 plane that crashed in the east end of Lake Ontario on its way to Griffiss Air Force Base near Rome , New York , on Sept. 11 , 1952. As the Democrat and Chronicle and Rome Sentinel report , the plane ' s left engine began to fail ; the five aboard decided to parachute out , with the pilot first putting the plane on autopilot in an attempt to crash it away from residential areas. But the plane , having lost nearly 1,000 pounds , gained altitude and took a slightly different course until its fuel ran out roughly 70 minutes later. story continues below At around 11pm the plane was seen flying low near Oswego , with witnesses saying "" a powerful light , like that of a searchlight , appeared for several seconds after the crash. "" A Coast Guard search began right away and was stopped two days later , without success. Enter Jim Kennard , Roger Pawlowski , and Roland Stevens , who have been scouring the Oswego end of Lake Ontario for ships for three years and found the plane "" well beyond the mile offshore reported by a few eyewitnesses , "" notes Kennard. He tells the Daily News the 34-foot-long plane doesn  t look too bad  sonar images show it ' s missing its nose cone , a blade , and part of its body behind the left wing , and a windshield is broken. ( Another discovery was recently made at the bottom of a Great Lake. )|||||The water level in Nevada ' s Lake Mead is at a ... The water level in Nevada ' s Lake Mead is at a record low of about 37 percent The water level in Nevada ' s Lake Mead is at a record low of about 37 percent Like reservoirs throughout the drought-stricken West , Nevada ' s Lake Mead is far below capacity , down more than 60 percent. But even as the drought deepens , tourists are flowing in. Lake Mead gets more visitors than either Yosemite or the Grand Canyon , and some are coming to see the surprising sites that are revealed as the lake shrinks , CBS News ' John Blackstone reports. The ruins of the Old West town of St. Thomas were hidden for decades under the water. But Lake Mead has receded so far that tourists can now hike 1 mile across the desert to examine what ' s left , with no water in sight. Lake Mead National Recreation Area public affairs officer Christie Vanover said she and Blackstone were standing in an area that in the 1990s would have been covered by 100 feet of water. St. Thomas was founded in 1865 by Mormon pioneers. It was a thriving and , at times , lawless town. "" Things got a little wild out here. There were some horse thieves. There were some cattle rustlers , "" Vanover said. When the U.S. government bought the land in the 1930s to make room for Lake Mead , it ' s been said a few residents refused to leave , believing the valley wouldn ' t flood. Another long-lost piece of history remains underwater , a B-29 Superfortress. It rests at a depth of about 105 feet , but shallow enough for sunlight to filter down. "" The other advantage of it being shallower is that more divers can actually access it , "" Tech Diving Unlimited ' s Joel Silverstein said. He leads about a 100 dives a year to the military relic. "" The B-29s were very important during World War II. They carried all the different bombs and a lot of people flew in them. And they were the most popular and most used plane in World War II , "" Silverstein said. Back in 1948 , that B-29 that crashed into the lake was on a secret mission. The crew of five survived , and the plane remained undisturbed for nearly 70 years. While there is certainly less water in Lake Mead , it ' s still the major attraction for most of the tourists who visit. Marina owner Bruce Nelson grew up at Lake Mead and said the lower water level has created some new hazards but also new scenery. "" You have new beaches , new coves , new things you can explore , "" he said. Lake Mead has always been at odds with its surroundings -- a mammoth body of water in one of the hottest , driest places in the West. While the long drought peels away some of its past , the prediction of heavy El Nio rains this winter may help ensure the lake ' s future and reclaim its historic treasures .|||||Bruce Nelson was just a baby when Lake Mead was at its mightiest. That was 1983  ancient history to the 32-year-old whose family has run marinas here for three generations  when the lake gushed over Hoover Dam like a desert Niagara Falls. But that was then. Now , the West remains mired in a lingering drought that has sapped the lake level to its lowest point since Mead was created in the 1930s. The drop has threatened water supplies for the entire Southwest , prompting officials to consider rationing. In September , the third and deepest intake pipe into the lake will be opened to ensure that Las Vegas-area consumers have water no matter how far Mead falls. Advertisement But Nelson says those already penning Lake Mead  s obituary are a bit premature. Tourism here is rebounding and the drought has brought an odd bonus : As waters recede , the lake has given up long-submerged secrets  a ghost town and B-29 bomber among them , history slowly revealed with the gentle care of an archaeologist  s brush. On a recent Friday , Nelson shuts off the engine of his Yamaha pleasure boat and floats in the aqua-green waters just off the dam wall. On either side of him , the rock face soars toward impossibly blue summer skies. Nelson  s family opened their first marina here in 1957 , and he grew up on this lake. His childhood playground now supports his livelihood. It  s just so unfair to say this lake is disappearing ,  he says. The lake is what it is. Do we prefer more water ? Sure. But even with less water , this is still one big , big lake.  Nelson has stopped in a place called Black Canyon , though its walls now bear the black-white contrast of a piano keyboard. The chalk-colored stone closest to the waterline , covered with residue from the retreating waters , is a measuring stick of just how far the lake level has fallen  from 1,226 feet to 1,075 feet in just 17 years , with most of that in the last few years. ------------ FOR THE RECORD July 6 , 12 : 07 p.m. : An earlier version of this story said the water level at Lake Mead fell from 2,026 feet to 1,075 feet. Actually , the high water mark was 1,226. ------------ Still , Lake Mead National Recreation Area remains the sixth most popular destination of the nation  s 407 national parks. With 7 million annual visitors , it draws more than the Grand Canyon , Yosemite or Yellowstone. Overall tourism here has plummeted 20 % since 1998 , when the water level began dropping , but recent trends are encouraging. Park officials say spring attendance was up 47 % from the same time the year before. So far this summer , attendance is up 30 % compared with a year earlier. Park officials credit the rise in part to the reviving economy. Nelson attributes the rebound to a scenic 450-mile shoreline that would stretch from San Diego north to Monterey. Nelson jets his craft around the lake  s shoreline , through inlets that have long been below water but are now being explored by boaters and swimmers. There  s the ghost town of St. Thomas , a former Mormon settlement founded 150 years ago and abandoned in 1938 as the converging Virgin and Muddy rivers filled a basin whose southern terminus was plugged by the Hoover Dam. The town on the lake  s northernmost finger near Overton began resurfacing a decade ago and has become so popular with hikers that park officials plan to install a series of information placards there. Nelson motors past once-submerged land masses such as Boulder Island  and others without names  that sit just offshore from the Las Vegas Boat Harbor. A few years ago , boats could ease through the two peaks that jutted skyward a few feet above the waterline , each marked by a green buoy. Now the girth of the land below is exposed , like a belly or the monstrous lower portion of an iceberg. The towering rock now serves as a windbreak for the marina. Nelson whips the Yamaha boat past the inactive Batch Plant , a circular-shaped facility that washed aggregate for the concrete used to make the Hoover Dam. Once accessible only to underwater divers , parts of the plant sit 50 feet out of the water. Recreational divers are now converging on another oddity : a World War II-era bomber that sank during a 1948 test-landing accident. While the wreck of the B-29 once rested beneath 260 feet of water , the site now lies just 120 feet below the surface. The ambient light makes this a more interesting dive ,  says Joel Silverstein , owner of Scuba Training and Technology , which leads tours to the wreck. Silverstein has seen an uptick in clientele , but he still worries about the health of the lake. The lower level of the lake is disturbing. That we  re able to go look at stuff now in shallower depths is the dark cloud  s silver lining.  Christie Vanover , a spokeswoman for the Lake Mead National Recreation Area , sees Lake Mead  s water level like a bank account. Water is money. Sometimes there  s ample money and sometimes there  s not. That  s when we  re not getting deposits from Lake Powell upriver and people downstream are making withdrawals.  Park managers are even contemplating the once-unthinkable : the 950-foot water mark , now just 125 feet away. We originally discussed 1,000 feet and then dropped to 950 ,  Vanover said. When we did that there was a moment of silence , like , Could we ever reach that level?   In beach areas , each 1-foot drop in water level exposes 30 feet of new shoreline. For Mead officials that has meant continually lengthening asphalt boat launches at half a dozen locations around Mead , which straddles Nevada and Arizona. In the last decade , officials have spent $ 36 million in launch construction and plan on spending another $ 2.3 million in 2015. In 2007 , officials relocated one marina  boats , berths and all. At others , the water line is so far away from public parking that managers use golf carts to ferry mariners to and from their boats. Nelson , however , insists on seeing what  s there , not fretting about what isn  t. As he guns his boat across open waters , he calls Mead a boater  s lake , with many of its hidden shores and attractions reachable only by water. On this day , Mead  s very existence seems improbable : a clear body of water surrounded by parched desert , a lunar landscape marked by black volcanic and red rock , and designated wilderness areas. Nelson slows his boat inside isolated Wishing Well Cove , where the lowering water level has exposed a panorama of overhanging rock walls , under which several children paddle about on a rubber raft. He slowly turns the boat beneath a now-dead quagga mussel , an invasive species that clings to a rock face once well below water. Nearby , a single duck bobs contentedly , as though unaware of the encroaching lake floor below. john.glionna@latimes.com Twitter : @jglionna MORE DROUGHT NEWS : Water agencies baffle conservationists with water use surge Drought puts California pool repairman who works underwater in high demand Drought drives greater household use of gray water|||||NPR  s sites use cookies , similar tracking and storage technologies , and information about the device you use to access our sites ( together , cookies  ) to enhance your viewing , listening and user experience , personalize content , personalize messages from NPR  s sponsors , provide social media features , and analyze NPR  s traffic.

54,"Certain places are prized by geologists , especially teachers , for their educational value. Out-of-towners make pilgrimages to them. Sure we all enjoy the Grand Canyon , but real geologists have Siccar Point , Darwin  s outcrop , the Carlin unconformity and other obscure sites on their life lists. One of those places was right nearby in Hayward , until very recently. At the corner of Rose and Prospect Streets is a corner curb that happened to be built precisely across the Hayward fault , where the steady progress of aseismic creep slowly wrenched it apart. The best time series of this corner was compiled by Sue Ellen Hirschfeld , a now-retired geology teacher at UC East Bay. It goes back to 1971 , and even then there was a sizable offset. Probably the curb was first emplaced in the late 1950s. It  s a popular site for folks in the know , and there  s at least one Flickr group with lots of photos. The neighbors are probably sick of us , though. I  ve visited it many times , and I sometimes took pictures. This photo is from 2006. We  re looking east across the fault. This side is moving northward a few millimeters per year. I came back the next year and took this shot of the echelon cracks  in the street , with the iconic curb in the corner. In 2012 I brought a few enthusiasts to see it ; they asked for anonymity but I can show you where they stood. A closeup at the time shows that it had a total offset of about 7-1/2 inches , or 20 centimeters , since it was built. The painted arrow at the left shows the offset in the six years since 2006. Last week I joined a party of visitors there , and to my dismay the corner has been dismantled. It looks like the plan is to put in a cutout for people with disabilities , which is a good thing and undoubtedly overdue. Still. Anyway , I  m here to put the word out : Rose and Prospect is defunct. It is no more. Come back in 20 years. In the meantime , downtown Hayward is full of other examples of bent curbs. There  s always the Old City Hall , too , which was built directly on the fault and has long been abandoned. The first time I visited there , maybe 25 years ago , I was looking at the street adjacent to it. As I watched , a little tongue of water emerged in the center of the street and started trickling downhill. Assuming that an old iron water main had just cracked , I found a phone booth and alerted the city. Cleaning up after a creeping fault never ends.

But a study published last week in Science Advances finds the San Andreas could have an equally dangerous partner in creating the state ' s next catastrophic quake. The Los Angeles Times reports geophysics professor Julian Lozos , while trying to solve the mystery of the earthquake of 1812 , determined that it ' s possible the San Andreas fault combined with the San Jacinto fault to cause a magnitude-7.5 earthquake  and could do so again. According to a press release , the 1812 earthquake was one of the biggest in California ' s history and now appears to have been caused when a rupture in the San Jacinto spread to the San Andreas. story continues below "" People shouldn ' t just be thinking about the San Andreas fault , "" Lozos says in the press release. The lesser-known San Jacinto could actually be a more serious "" seismic hazard "" because it runs directly under a number of population centers east of Los Angeles. If it combined with the San Andreas to create a "" Big One ""  as evidence shows it has in the past  the resulting earthquake could kill more than 1,000 people while destroying buildings and starting fires , what the Times calls a "" grim seismic scenario. "" Lozos says it ' s important to understand how one fault rupturing can trigger ruptures in others. A recent report taking similar multi-fault thinking into account raised California ' s odds for having a magnitude-8 or larger earthquake by 2045 from 4.7 % to 7 % . ( Read more earthquake stories. )|||||For nearly half a century , thousands trekked to Rose and Prospect streets to behold a slice of sidewalk that , by conventional standards , had no curb appeal. Pulled apart so that it no longer aligned , the humble curb wasn  t much to look at. But for earthquake scientists , it was a kind of Holy Grail , perfectly illustrating the seismic forces at work underneath this Bay Area neighborhood. Since at least the 1970s , scientists have painstakingly photographed the curb as the Hayward fault pushed it farther and farther out of alignment. It was a sharp reminder that someday , a magnitude 7 earthquake would strike directly beneath one of the most heavily populated areas in Northern California. Then , one early June day , a city crew decided to fix the faulty curb  pun intended. By doing what cities are supposed to do  fixing streets  the city  s action stunned scientists , who said a wonderful curbside laboratory for studying earthquakes was destroyed. They really took it out. Wow ,  David Schwartz , a U.S. Geological Survey geologist , said when he clicked on a photo of the curb  s destruction. It really was an iconic location on the Hayward fault.  Andrew Alden , an Oakland science writer , was among the first to document the curb  s destruction. He was invited by the U.S. Geological Survey to come to that intersection on the last Friday of June , as a scientist hoped to give emergency preparedness officials a chance to see what a real fault looks like.  It  s sad. It was a real letdown ,  said Alden , whose tweet and blog post about the intersection was picked up by Canadian media. It  s really unusual to have such a clean piece of evidence right here.  But Hayward officials said they had no idea this curb had such sacred significance for geologists. We weren  t aware of it ,  said Kelly McAdoo , assistant city manager. She said the curb was replaced to install a wheelchair-accessible ramp at that intersection , one of about 150 to 170 such ramps that are installed every year at a cost of $ 3,000 each. Our mandate from our council is that we have safe sidewalks and accessible sidewalks for all members of our community ,  she said , adding that the city might have acted differently had it known about the curb  s geological significance. Interested in the stories shaping California ? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >> We probably would have looked at it differently , or we would have tried to help them document it ,  McAdoo said , adding that if scientists want to share information with the city about sites used to monitor seismic activity , we  d be happy to talk with them  to see whether there  s a way to alert city crews about their geologic significance. But she said the city has a responsibility to maintain safe streets and roads. When you  ve got a curb that  s offset , we probably would eventually want to fix it and see if there  s some other way to monitor seismic safety over time.  The Times sent McAdoo a link to photos showing the curb offset growing since the 1970s , and she said the initial reaction among some employees was , Look at how offset the curb is. We need to fix that.  746473841342328832 The curb was once straight , running perpendicular to the Hayward fault , which runs in a north-south direction. But over the years , the eastern half of the curb got pulled south , while the other side got pulled north. This curb was once flush but became offset because the Hayward fault is pulling the curb apart. ( Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times ) The intersection has long been watched with reverence. A website called geologyfieldtrips.com features scanned photos showing the same curb in 1971  already displaying the telltale signs of being pulled apart. By 1987 , the curb was completely offset , courtesy of a fault that geologists say is one of the Bay Area  s most worrisome. The Hayward fault courses right underneath Berkeley , Oakland , Hayward and Fremont and produces a large earthquake , on average , every 160 years , with a margin of error of about 80 years. It has been 148 years since the Hayward fault last ruptured , unleashing a huge earthquake. We  re kind of in the range where something could happen at any time ,  Schwartz said. On its website , the USGS calls the Hayward fault the region  s tectonic time bomb ,  which could cause hundreds of deaths , leave thousands homeless and devastate the region  s economy.  On top of the Hayward fault , Schwartz said , sits two million people who directly live on top of it. It sits geographically in the center of the Bay Area. There  s a tremendous amount of infrastructure built up on it  water systems , gas , electrical , BART crosses it  so a large event on that fault is like hitting the bullseye on a target.  Famously , the Hayward fault  s ongoing movement forced Hayward to shutter its historic city hall , which remains standing and is slowly being torn up by the fault  s movement. The historic Hayward City Hall was closed because it sits directly on top of the Hayward fault , which is pulling the building apart. ( Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times ) Cracks in the historic Hayward City Hall are formed by the slow , persistent movement of the Hayward fault. ( Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times ) There are other , more subtle signs of the Hayward fault  s influence in the city  s downtown. Some curbs and sidewalks have bends or cracks in them that geologists know are clear evidence of the fault  s movement. Some cracks travel up vertical structures , including buildings where people work or live. A broken curb shows the path of the Hayward fault in another area of Hayward. ( Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times ) If it was up to us , we would put signs up on all of these active faults ,  showing people where they  re crossing the Hayward fault or the San Andreas fault , Schwartz said.

55,"[ Watch the Video : NASA Tech Will Hunt For Heartbeats After Disasters ] Michael Harper for redOrbit.com  Your Universe Online NASA , in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , has developed a new technology which can detect heartbeats behind 20 feet of solid concrete or 30 feet of crushed material. This radar-based technology will be used in emergency situations where victims are trapped beneath collapsed buildings and other rubble. The government agencies have been testing prototypes of this device for the last several months , and now they expect the first commercialized model of the product to be available by spring of 2014. Recent improvements in the design include a lightweight core , USB antenna and increased battery life of up to 14 hours. NASA scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California , along with Science and Technology Directorate from the DHS , are calling this device Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response ,  or FINDER. So far they  ve tested the unit in more than 65 simulated disasters with two Urban Search and Rescue Teams : The Virginia Task Force 1 at the Fairfax County Fire Department training center , and the Virginia Task Force 2 in Virginia Beach , Va. Their goal was to create a tool that these teams could use to find signs of life in catastrophic situations. With this technology , lives could be saved which may have been lost forever underneath the rubble created by a tornado , earthquake or hurricane. The portable radar was able to penetrate concrete , rebar and other materials to distinguish heartbeats several feet away. When out in the open , the unit can detect a human heartbeat up to 100 feet away. Testing proved successful in locating a task force member buried in 30 feet of mixed concrete , rebar and gravel rubble from a distance of over 30 feet ,  said DHS Science and Technology program manager John Price in a statement. This capability will complement the current urban search and rescue tools such as canines , listening devices and video cameras to detect the presence of living victims in rubble.  The duo of the DHS and JPL seems to be a good fit in more ways than one. Edward Chow , JPL program manager , said the crushed and mangled material of a disaster presented some challenges for early prototypes of the device. Radar waves shot into the wreckage would bounce around and return irregular signals and , therefore , inaccurate results. Isolating the relatively weak signal of a heartbeat within the noisy signals becomes a difficult task ,  said Chow. JPL  s radar expertise helps in this challenge.  The microwave radar technology isn  t just sensitive enough to distinguish the faint movement and sound of a heartbeat. It  s also smart enough to know if it  s hearing  a human heartbeat or the heartbeat of some other living thing , such as a rat. These processing systems allow search and rescue operators to quickly understand if any survivors are trapped underneath slabs of concrete and debris and allow them to begin the process of extracting them. After thorough testing of the earliest prototype , the DHS and JPL team decided to make a few changes to the design to improve the overall functionality of the device. One unit can perform all these tasks , including powering an antenna , a radar unit and digital processing , all with a single USB interface. The team also decided to change the user interface to make it easier to use by search and rescue teams. Future iterations of this device are expected to be even smaller and therefore easier to bring into disaster areas. The DHS and JPL will demonstrate this new unit at a presentation next Wednesday in Virgina .|||||NASA engineers have built a device that uses radar to detect heartbeats in the rubble of collapsed buildings , with technology typically used to explore other planets. The FINDER device , developed with the Department of Homeland Security , could help search-and-rescue teams find survivors trapped underneath the wreckage  even when those victims can  t call for help. Identifying people who are still alive in a collapsed building is a major challenge for urban rescue missions , said Jim Lux , task manager at Jet Propulsion Laboratory for FINDER ( short for Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response ) . Trapped victims often can  t be heard , and using microphones to pick up their voices depends on their ability to call for help. The other search technique relies on the victims making noise ,  Lux said. The JPL device can find an unconscious and unresponsive victim.  This new technology uses radar , the same technique employed by missile guidance systems and air traffic control. FINDER sends out a low-powered microwave signal  a fraction of what cellphones use  toward the rubble. Some of the microwave light bounces off of the rubble , but some of it manages to penetrate the debris and bounce off of trapped victims. Advertisement Unlike the rubble , the victim is actually moving rhythmically. The chest rises and falls as the victim breathes , and moves from heart beats  and the head moves as the veins on the scalp fill and empty out , Lux said. So that nearly imperceptible movement creates slight differences in timing when the waves bounce back , which the device can pick up. We looked for really tiny motions ,  Lux said. The researchers can distinguish people from animals , Lux said , because humans have a fairly unique range of heartbeats and respiration rates , and experts can use them in combination to identify human victims. As for how they differentiate a signal potentially filled with heartbeats and breathing from other random movements ( like a tree rustling ) , researchers use a technique called signal processing  something engineers at JPL are well-versed in , Lux said. It is basically the same technique radio astronomers use to identify individual pulsars from all the background noise , or to decipher a faint wobble in the signal from a spacecraft around Jupiter or Saturn. At a training site in Lorton , Va. , JPL engineers on Wednesday gave members of the urban search-and-rescue team Virginia Task Force 1 the device to test out in the rubble of a collapsed building. Volunteer victims had earlier crawled into the wreckage through strategically placed concrete pipes and waited to see if they were discovered. FINDER picked up all four volunteer victims in the first round , and got full marks in the second round as well , Lux said. The test also provided other feedback. Searching a house-sized building ( about 30 by 30 feet ) would take about 10 minutes , Lux said , while it took roughly half an hour to find the volunteer victims in a much larger structure ( approximately 100 feet by 250 feet , Lux estimated ) . The rescuers wanted the device to work faster , and Lux said researchers could likely cut the time in half. That  s why it  s important to talk to search-and-rescue folks ,  Lux said. They have a wealth of knowledge about the things that work in the field that we just don  t have.  ALSO : A hunt for dark matter in a former gold mine Eureka !

During these missions , time is imperative , and the ability to quickly detect living victims greatly increases the chances of rescue and survival. The Department of Homeland Security ' s Science and Technology Directorate , Washington , and NASA ' s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , have developed a new radar-based technology named Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response , or FINDER. FINDER was created to detect a human heartbeat buried beneath 30 feet ( 9 meters ) of crushed material , hidden behind 20 feet ( 6 meters ) of solid concrete , and from a distance of 100 feet ( 30 meters ) in open space. In the past several months , DHS and JPL have tested and developed several FINDER prototypes. In June , DHS and first responders used a prototype to conduct more than 65 test searches with two Urban Search and Rescue teams : the Virginia Task Force 1 at the Fairfax County Fire Department training center , and the Virginia Task Force 2 in Virginia Beach , Va. "" Testing proved successful in locating a task force member buried in 30 feet of mixed concrete , rebar and gravel rubble from a distance of over 30 feet , "" said John Price , DHS Science and Technology program manager. "" This capability will complement the current urban search and rescue tools such as canines , listening devices and video cameras to detect the presence of living victims in rubble. "" In disaster scenarios , like earthquakes and tornadoes , the debris from the disasters causes the radar signals of FINDER to bounce back irregularly , making it difficult to decipher the signals. "" Isolating the relatively weak signal of a heartbeat within the noisy signals becomes a difficult task , "" said Edward Chow , JPL program manager. "" JPL ' s radar expertise helps in this challenge. "" JPL uses advanced data processing systems to pick out faint signals. The microwave radar technology is sensitive enough to distinguish the unique signature of a human ' s breathing pattern and heartbeat from that of other living creatures , such as rats. The advantage of this technology is to allow first responders to quickly ascertain if a living human is present in the debris. The technology is sensitive enough that victims , whether conscious or not , can easily be detected , which helps responders decide the most efficient course of action. "" It is anticipated that a commercialized technology could be ready for search and rescue operations as early as spring 2014 , "" Price said. The earlier tests resulted in design changes that are being incorporated into a new version of the device. These changes include a revised user interface , and increased battery life of up to 14 hours. The mechanical and electronic design has evolved with the core being a lightweight sensing module that uses a USB interface to integrate an antenna , radar electronics and digital processing. "" This module is the key to future miniaturization and the use of FINDER sensing technology in other applications , "" said James Lux , task manager for the FINDER project at JPL. Those applications include installing FINDER on proposed search and rescue robots , such as JPL ' s Urbie , on stretchers or ambulances to monitor a patient ' s heartbeat , and in biology research to distinguish species. The research partners continue developmental efforts to construct a final prototype while using a wealth of practitioner input and recommendations following the test searches. Future phases of development will focus on a more specific locator function , which will help determine not only the presence of a victim , but more precisely where in the rubble the victim is located.

But the total number of trees has plummeted by roughly 46 % since the start of human civilization , the study estimates. Using a combination of satellite imagery , forest inventories , and supercomputer technologies , the international team of researchers was able to map tree populations worldwide at the square-kilometer level. Their results , published in the journal Nature , provide the most comprehensive assessment of tree populations ever produced and offer new insights into a class of organism that helps shape most terrestrial biomes. The new insights can improve the modeling of many large-scale systems , from carbon cycling and climate change models to the distribution of animal and plant species , say the researchers. Trees are among the most prominent and critical organisms on Earth , yet we are only recently beginning to comprehend their global extent and distribution ,  said Thomas Crowther , a Yale Climate &amp; Energy Institute postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies ( F&ES ) and lead author of the study. They store huge amounts of carbon , are essential for the cycling of nutrients , for water and air quality , and for countless human services ,  he added. Yet you ask people to estimate , within an order of magnitude , how many trees there are and they don  t know where to begin. I don  t know what I would have guessed , but I was certainly surprised to find that we were talking about trillions.  The study was inspired by a request by Plant for the Planet , a global youth initiative that leads the United Nations Environment Programme  s Billion Tree Campaign.  Two years ago the group approached Crowther asking for baseline estimates of tree numbers at regional and global scales so they could better evaluate the contribution of their efforts and set targets for future tree-planting initiatives. At the time , the only global estimate was just over 400 billion trees worldwide , or about 61 trees for every person on Earth. That prediction was generated using satellite imagery and estimates of forest area , but did not incorporate any information from the ground. The new study used a combination of approaches to reveal that there are 3.04 trillion trees  roughly 422 trees per person. Crowther and his colleagues collected tree density information from more than 400,000 forest plots around the world. This included information from several national forest inventories and peer-reviewed studies , each of which included tree counts that had been verified at the ground level. Using satellite imagery , they were then able to assess how the number of trees in each of those plots is related to local characteristics such as climate , topography , vegetation , soil condition , and human impacts. The diverse array of data available today allowed us to build predictive models to estimate the number of trees at each location around the globe ,  said Yale postdoctoral student Henry Glick , second author of the study. The resulting map has the potential to inform scientists about the structure of forest ecosystems in different regions , and it can be used to improve predictions about carbon storage and biodiversity around the world. Most global environmental data is thematically coarse ,  said Matthew Hansen , a global forestry expert from the University of Maryland who was not involved in the study. The study of Crowther et al. moves us towards a needed direct quantification of tree distributions , information ready to be used by a host of downstream science investigations.  The highest densities of trees were found in the boreal forests in the sub-arctic regions of Russia , Scandinavia , and North America. But the largest forest areas , by far , are in the tropics , which are home to about 43 % of the world  s trees. ( Only 24 % are in the dense boreal regions , while another 22 % exist in temperate zones. ) The results illustrate how tree density changes within forest types. Researchers found that climate can help predict tree density in most biomes. In wetter areas , for instance , more trees are able to grow. However , the positive effects of moisture were reversed in some regions because humans typically prefer the moist , productive areas for agriculture. In fact , human activity is the largest driver of tree numbers worldwide , said Crowther. While the negative impact of human activity on natural ecosystems is clearly visible in small areas , the study provides a new measure of the scale of anthropogenic effects , highlighting how historical land use decisions have shaped natural ecosystems on a global scale. In short , tree densities usually plummet as the human population increases. Deforestation , land-use change , and forest management are responsible for a gross loss of over 15 billion trees each year. We  ve nearly halved the number of trees on the planet , and we  ve seen the impacts on climate and human health as a result ,  Crowther said. This study highlights how much more effort is needed if we are to restore healthy forests worldwide.  Researchers from 15 countries collaborated on the study. There were 14 researchers from across the Yale community who contributed to the study. Yale Forestry &amp; Environmental Study ' s Thomas Crowther talks about the study to map the world ' s trees .|||||The ability of Earth ' s forests to stand up to droughts may be worse than previously believed. The Washington Post reports that many current scientific models assume trees recover immediately following a drought. But Princeton ' s William Anderegg demonstrated droughts actually have "" legacy effects "" on trees in a study published earlier this year. According to Live Science , Anderegg explained the problem Monday at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting. Trees have to work harder to suck up water during a drought ; that creates air bubbles in the tree ' s vascular system that can lead to water- and nutrient-blocking embolisms. Anderegg ' s team found that droughts can continue to affect trees for up to four years after normal conditions return. story continues below During the years following a drought , trees are prevented from growing at their normal rates , possibly hurting the amount of carbon dioxide they pull out of the atmosphere , the Post reports. Even worse , dead trees dump greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere , creating a feedback loop of more droughts and dead trees. While climate models suggest droughts will become more frequent and severe in the coming years , Anderegg tells Live Science it ' s not too late to prevent the worst of it by reducing carbon emissions. "" The future of a lot of these forests really rests in our hands ,  he tells the Post. The sooner and the more effectively we address climate change , the less risks forests will face.

57,"An aerial view of the coral reef and deep cave that make up the famous diving spot of the Blue Hole in the Caribbean Sea , off the coast of Belize. SAN FRANCISCO  The ancient Mayan civilization collapsed due to a century-long drought , new research suggests. Minerals taken from Belize ' s famous underwater cave , known as the Blue Hole , as well as lagoons nearby , show that an extreme drought occurred between A.D. 800 and A.D. 900 , right when the Mayan civilization disintegrated. After the rains returned , the Mayans moved north  but they disappeared again a few centuries later , and that disappearance occurred at the same time as another dry spell , the sediments reveal. [ In Photos : Stunning Sinkholes ] Although the findings aren ' t the first to tie a drought to the Mayan culture ' s demise , the new results strengthen the case that dry periods were indeed the culprit. That ' s because the data come from several spots in a region central to the Mayan heartland , said study co-author Andr Droxler , an Earth scientist at Rice University. Rise and decline From A.D. 300 to A.D. 700 , the Mayan civilization flourished in the Yucatan peninsula. These ancient Mesoamericans built stunning pyramids , mastered astronomy , and developed both a hieroglyphic writing system and a calendar system , which is famous for allegedly predicting that the world would end in 2012. But in the centuries after A.D. 700 , the civilization ' s building activities slowed and the culture descended into warfare and anarchy. Historians have speculatively linked that decline with everything from the ancient society ' s fear of malevolent spirits to deforestation completed to make way for cropland to the loss of favored foods , such as the Tikal deer. The evidence for a drought has been growing in recent years : Since at least 1995 , scientists have been looking more closely at the effects of drought. A 2012 study in the journal Science analyzed a 2,000-year-old stalagmite from a cave in southern Belize and found that sharp decreases in rainfall coincided with periods of decline in the culture. But that data came from just one cave , which meant it was difficult to make predictions for the area as a whole , Droxler said. The main driver of this drought is thought to have been a shift in the intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) , a weather system that generally dumps water on tropical regions of the world while drying out the subtropics. During summers , the ITCZ pelts the Yucatan peninsula with rain , but the system travels farther south in the winter. Many scientists have suggested that during the Mayan decline , this monsoon system may have missed the Yucatan peninsula altogether. Deep history To look for signs of drought , the team drilled cores from the sediments in the Blue Hole of Lighthouse lagoon , as well one in the Rhomboid reef. The lagoons surrounded on all sides by thick walls of coral reef. During storms or wetter periods , excess water runs off from rivers and streams , overtops the retaining walls , and is deposited in a thin layer at the top of the lagoon. From there , all the sediments from these streams settle to the bottom of the lagoon , piling on top of each other and leaving a chronological record of the historical climate. "" It ' s like a big bucket. It ' s a sediment trap , "" Droxler told Live Science. Droxler and his colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of the cores , in particular the ratio of titanium to aluminum. When the rains fall , it eats away at the volcanic rocks of the region , which contain titanium. The free titanium then sweeps into streams that reach the ocean. So relatively low ratios of titanium to aluminum correspond to periods with less rainfall , Droxler said. The team found that during the period between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000 , when the Maya civilization collapsed , there were just one or two tropical cyclones every two decades , as opposed to the usual five or six. After that , the Maya moved north , building at sites such as Chichen Itza , in what is now Mexico. But the new results also found that between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1100 , during the height of the Little Ice Age , another major drought struck. This period coincides with the fall of Chichen Itza. The findings strengthen the case that drought helped usher in the long decline of the Mayan culture. "" When you have major droughts , you start to get famines and unrest , "" Droxler said.

Originally published on Live Science .|||||It  s long been one of ancient history  s most intriguing mysteries : Why did the Maya , a remarkably sophisticated civilization made up of more than 19 million people , suddenly collapse sometime during the 8th or 9th centuries ? Although the Mayan people never entirely disappeared  their descendants still live across Central America  dozens of core urban areas in the lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula , such as Tikal , went from bustling cities to abandoned ruins over the course of roughly a hundred years. Scholars and laypeople have proposed countless theories accounting for the collapse , ranging from the plausible ( overhunting , foreign invasion , peasant revolt ) to the absurd ( alien invasion , supernatural forces ) . In his 2005 book Collapse , though , Jared Diamond put forth a different sort of theory  that a prolonged drought , exacerbated by ill-advised deforestation , forced Mayan populations to abandon their cities. That hypothesis has finally been put to the test with archaeological evidence and environmental data and the results published this week in a pair of studies. In the first study , published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers from Arizona State University analyzed archaeological data from across the Yucatan to reach a better understanding of the environmental conditions when the area was abandoned. Around this time , they found , severe reductions in rainfall were coupled with an rapid rate of deforestation , as the Mayans burned and chopped down more and more forest to clear land for agriculture. Interestingly , they also required massive amounts of wood to fuel the fires that cooked the lime plaster for their elaborate constructions  experts estimate it would have taken 20 trees to produce a single square meter of cityscape. The other study , published by researchers from Columbia University and elsewhere this week in Geophysical Research Letters , applied quantitative data to these trends. Using population records and measurements from current forested and cleared lands in the region , they constructed a computer model of deforestation in the Yucatan and ran simulations to see how this would have affected rainfall. Because cleared land absorbs less solar radiation , less water evaporates from its surface , making clouds and rainfall more scarce. As a result , the rapid deforestation exacerbated an already severe drought  in the simulation , deforestation reduced precipitation by five to 15 percent and was responsible for 60 percent of the total drying that occurred over the course of a century as the Mayan civilization collapsed. The lack of forest cover also contributed to erosion and soil depletion. In a time of unprecedented population density , this combination of factors was likely catastrophic. Crops failed , especially because the droughts occurred disproportionately during the summer growing season. Coincidentally , trade shifted from overland routes , which crossed the heart of the lowland , to sea-based voyages , moving around the perimeter of the peninsula. Since the traditional elite relied largely upon this trade  along with annual crop surpluses  to build wealth , they were sapped of much of their power. This forced peasants and craftsmen into making a critical choice , perhaps necessary to escape starvation : abandoning the lowlands. The results are the ornate ruins that stretch across the peninsula today. The collapse is especially intriguing because it seemingly occurred at a time in which developed a sophisticated understanding of their environment , built and sustained intensive production and water systems and withstood at least two long-term episodes of aridity ,  says B.L. Turner , the lead author of the ASU study. In other words , the Maya were no fools. They knew their environment and how to survive within it  and still they continued deforesting at a rapid pace , until the local environment was unable to sustain their society. One of the lessons of these complementary studies , says climate modeler Robert Oglesby of the University of Nebraska , who worked on the second paper , is that our reshaping of the environment can often have unintended consequences  and we may not have any idea of what they are until it  s too late. For a present-day example , we can even look to another region where the ancient Maya lived , Guatemala , which is undergoing rapid deforestation. There  s a tremendous amount of change going on in Guatemala ,  said Oglesby. They may be that much more vulnerable to a severe drought . |||||Just a week after news broke of a "" lost city "" discovered in Cambodia , archaeologists have uncovered an ancient Mayan city among the dense foliage of the Mexican jungle.

58,"Fire expert : Mount Rushmore fireworks show ill-advised  due to dry conditions and high fire risk Abnormally dry conditions and a persistent risk of summer wildfires in the Black Hills of South Dakota make the fireworks display planned for July 3 at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial an unnecessary , potentially devastating and expensive event , according to one fire expert with intimate knowledge of the region. Bill Gabbert , former fire management officer for Mount Rushmore and six other national parks in the region , said the controversial fireworks show that could attract 7,500 people , possibly including President Donald Trump , would be ill advised  even when conditions are not as dry as they are now. Burning debris , the burning embers and unexploded shells fall into a ponderosa pine forest and ponderosa pine is extremely flammable ,  said Gabbert. Shooting fireworks over a ponderosa pine forest , or any flammable vegetation , is ill advised and should not be done. Period.  Earlier : More than 125,000 tickets requested for Mount Rushmore Fourth of July fireworks In April and May of 2020 , the Black Hills fell 30 % to 50 % short of moisture compared to the long-term precipitation average for the region. Long range forecasts for June indicate that hotter and drier-than-average conditions will continue until July. On June 4 , the U.S. Drought Monitor labeled nearly all of southwestern South Dakota , including most of the Black Hills , as abnormally dry.  Such dry conditions have historically been a driving force behind increased fire activity in the region , said Darren Clabo , South Dakota state wildfire meteorologist. The critical thing is , this is the time of the year when we get most of our rain. And so when we  re starting to see precipitation deficits during the time period when we get all the rain , it does become quite concerning looking forward to our fire season ,  Clabo said. The Black Hills and the area around the monument are dominated by fire-prone ponderosa pine forests , making the cities , towns and wilderness area in that region of western South Dakota far more vulnerable to wildfire , according to the U.S. Forest Service. Homes and businesses in and around the town of Keystone , about three miles northeast of Mount Rushmore , have a 95 % greater risk from wildfire than communities in all other parts of South Dakota , according to the forest service Wildfire and Risk to Communities  mapping tool. The floor of a ponderosa pine forest tends to accumulate dry , dead grass and brush every spring. In the past , the dead grass and brush acted as a fuel source for frequent , low intensity fires caused by lightning. The fires would burn through the grass and brush and make way for new growth. Ponderosa pines , which are well adapted to fire , generally wouldn  t catch on fire and would survive. Intense , landscape-altering fires were rare. But over the 20th century and into the 21st century , aggressive fire suppression efforts throughout the Black Hills interrupted the fire cycle and actually increased the potential for larger , more destructive fires. Fire protection in the Black Hills is compounded by the fact that the forest is dotted with hundreds of small , isolated , private homes and cabins. The South Dakota legislature recognized the serious threat to life and property decades ago when it passed a law banning fireworks sales and use within the Black Hills Forest Fire Protection District. There  s a reason that we have that in place ,  said Clabo. There is a reason why we  ve told the public that we shouldn  t be lighting fireworks off in this area.  The National Park Service , which manages the memorial , has determined that launching fireworks at Mount Rushmore would pose only a slight fire risk. In an environmental assessment conducted as part of the 2020 fireworks planning process , NPS staff estimated that , under normal conditions , there was a .02 % chance of a 15- to 30-minute display igniting a wildfire that could threaten nearby homes , businesses or campgrounds. However , the assessment said the risk of sparking a major fire would rise if the region were to be abnormally dry. Meanwhile , the chance of sparking a smaller fire that only affects the forest within the memorial was estimated at 60 % if conditions were normal. The Black Hills have been home to several major fires over the years , the most recent coming in December 2017 when the Legion Lake Fire about 20 miles southeast of Mount Rushmore burned more than 54,000 acres over five days and required 350 personnel and $ 2.5 million in costs to extinguish. That fire started from a downed powerline and was discovered within 10 minutes of ignition. State has ' go/no-go ' checklist for fireworks display In response to questions from South Dakota News Watch about the fire risk , Gov. Kristi Noem  s communications director Ian Fury said the park service has taken several precautions , including performing an environmental assessment , conducting a large controlled burn within the memorial  s borders in April and creating a safety Go/ No-Go  checklist that would be used to determine whether the risk posed by the fireworks is too high to continue the event as planned. The Go/No-Go checklist for the event was developed in collaboration with several state , local , and federal agencies. This checklist is based primarily on forecasted and current weather and fuels conditions that are used to predict fire behavior as well as the availability of fire suppression resources ,  Fury said in an emailed statement. What the park service  s Go/No Go checklist covers , and under what conditions the fireworks could be cancelled , have not been released to the public. In response to a request from News Watch for details , Maureen McGee-Ballinger , chief interpretation and education officer for Mount Rushmore , said National Park Service law enforcement officials have decided not to release the criteria for security reasons. South Dakota Secretary of Tourism Jim Hagen said safety is the state  s top priority in planning for the event. The world will have their eyes on South Dakota and we want to put our best foot forward. The event will be conditioned on appropriate weather , security and wildland fire conditions prior to the event ,  Hagen said. Fire wasn  t the only concern the NPS environmental assessment examined. The trash left behind by exploded fireworks , including paper and cardboard , and even unexploded shells were found to harm the memorial  s aesthetics and pollute nearby water supplies. A 2016 U.S. Geological Survey found that several chemicals in fireworks , most prominently perchlorate , had leached into Mouth Rushmore  s groundwater. Perchlorate , when ingested at high levels , has been known to affect human thyroid function , the environmental assessment said. The NPS added a reverse osmosis filtration system to its staff housing to reduce the chance of park employees being harmed by the chemicals. Past fireworks events at Mount Rushmore also left scorch marks on top of the sculpture. At least two other large Fourth of July fireworks displays in South Dakota have been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Watertown , the fireworks display at the Terry Redlin Art Center was cancelled in late April. The annual Jaycees fireworks show at the Sioux Empire Fairgrounds in Sioux Falls was also cancelled , but the show has since been revived by the fireworks vendor and a local radio station. The Sioux Falls event will be moved to the municipal Elmwood Golf Course , and spectators will be able watch from their cars while maintaining social distancing , organizers have said. State officials have said that COVID-19 safety measures recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  such as limiting large gatherings , requiring people to be six feet apart and the wearing of masks  will not be required of attendees at the Rushmore show. A city official in Keystone said her biggest worry heading up to the fireworks show is parking. The Fourth of July fireworks display at Mount Rushmore has drawn huge crowds in the past and Keystone just doesn  t have enough parking for everybody , said Lynette Gohsman , president of the town Board of Trustees. In general , Gohsman said , business owners in Keystone are excited for the event and the influx of visitors and revenue the event is likely to bring. The fireworks were taken away years ago because of the fire danger. I don  t think they would have brought them back if that was still a huge concern ,  Gohsman said. Gabbert , who worked for the National Park Service during the late 1990s and 2000s , created a similar Go/No Go checklist after Mount Rushmore started hosting a fireworks display in 1998. The checklist Gabbert devised included an analysis of weather conditions and forest dryness as well as a process for determining how likely the fireworks would be to start a fire. In 2002 , the fireworks were cancelled due to excessively dry conditions. Mount Rushmore firework displays present firefighters with unique challenges , Gabbert said. The terrain is steep and broken and firefighters can  t move in to put out smoldering debris until the display is finished , meaning they must hike around in the dark looking for fires in broken terrain. It  s very difficult because of the steepness of the rocks. It  s hard to get around. It  s hard to navigate through the rocky terrain , in the dark especially ,  said Gabbert , who is now retired and lives in the Black Hills where he publishes a wildfire news blog called Wildfire Today. Of the 21 fires Mount Rushmore fireworks displays have set off in the past , none got out of control. When Gabbert was the memorial  s fire manager , there usually were 60 or more firefighters standing by to spot fires and mop up once the fireworks displays were over. Firefighters were able to get to the scene of the small fires before they could get out of hand , Gabbert said. After 2009 , though , the risk of wildfire became too high and the park service stopped hosting fireworks. At the time , a mountain pine beetle infestation in the Black Hills killed thousands of trees and created significant dry fuels that made even professionally organized fireworks displays too risky. The beetle infestation was declared over in 2016 and almost immediately leaders in the tourism industry began calling for a return of the Mount Rushmore fireworks. In May 2019 , the National Park Service , at the urging of President Trump , began working with Noem and the state tourism department to bring the event back. More SD NewsWatch : Small towns in South Dakota facing big challenges amid pandemic and historic declines Twice in 2019 , Trump tweeted about fireworks at Mount Rushmore and on May 1 , 2020 , he said in an interview with a conservative podcast host that he planned to attend the event. He may be joined by 7,500 other observers who will receive free tickets chosen by a lottery run by the state. When the application period ended on June 8 , roughly 25,000 applicants had asked for a total of 125,000 tickets. The state of South Dakota , which is paying a majority of the event costs , has contracted with the California-based company Pyro Spectaculars for the fireworks. The display is expected to last 18 minutes and cost $ 350,000. Company officials toured the monument and surrounding area in late May in preparation for the show. There is no estimate for how many people will try to watch the fireworks from outside the memorial boundaries , Hagen said. What we do know is that locals should be aware that this fireworks display may be different than in year ' s past ,  Hagen said. We cannot guarantee where you will be able to see this outside of the memorial grounds . |||||President Trump Donald TrumpStunning survey gives grim view of flourishing anti-democratic opinions Southwest investigating report pilot said ' Let ' s go Brandon ' on flight Texas police refused requests to escort Biden bus surrounded by Trump supporters : report MORE said Friday that he plans to travel to South Dakota to view a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore on July 3 after his administration lifted environmental restrictions that prevented such displays.

ADVERTISEMENT There have not been fireworks at the monument since 2009 , but the Department of the Interior performed an environmental assessment that found there would be "" no significant impact "" if the show proceeded this year.

He is scheduled to spend the weekend at Camp David , and will travel to Arizona next week .|||||Despite President Trump ' s insistence , the July 3 fireworks at Mount Rushmore are a fire risk. Commercial fireworks are serious pyrotechnics and require careful planning and wide margins. Mount Rushmore is surrounded by a protected ponderosa forest experiencing a drought. President Donald Trump plans to attend a July 3 fireworks show at Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone , South Dakota  the first such celebration since 2009. South Dakota governor Kristi Noem has pushed to bring the fireworks back , and she insists the environmental factors are overblown. What can burn ? It ' s stone ,  President Trump said in January . But the iconic landmark isn  t just a single mountain with some faces on it in the middle of a desert , as forests are an essential part of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. The ponderosa forest that surrounds the sculpture is a climax community , which is like the apex predator of plants. It  s an age-old biosphere that can only be taken down by a catastrophe. Shooting fireworks over a ponderosa pine forest , or any flammable vegetation , is ill advised and should not be done. Period ,  former Mount Rushmore fire management officer Bill Gabbert told the Argus Leader. Indeed , Dynamite Fireworks says in its list of best practices  that users should clear out any leaves or other fire hazards  in the area and consider wetting the entire surface of grass within a 500-foot radius. Certainly an entire ponderosa forest counts as leaves ,  but maybe it won  t be so bad ... right ? Well , rainfall in the Black Hills region is down as much as 50 percent this year compared to average rainfall , and the fire service rates communities surrounding Mount Rushmore at nearly 100 percent more fire risk. Let  s do some math and look at the area around Mount Rushmore. We zoomed in on Google Maps until the scale unit was 200 feet , then we used that to make a kind of perimeter where the ponderosa trees begin around the mountain. Caroline Delbert As you can see , there  s nowhere with the recommended 500 feet of clearance , and again , that  s the bare minimum. Pyrotechnician and TV personality Mike Tockstein  s website details the nitty gritty of fireworks shows. In lived reality , commercial fireworks can fly as high as 1200 feet , meaning even a slight angle at launch translates to many feet outside the minimum radius. When a shell bursts at its apex , those particles can fly in any direction , with a visible width ( burst diameter  ) of up to 360 feet. While Governor Noem says the technology has "" improved "" since 2009 , can she guarantee fireworks will be shot straight up , explode in place , and drop straight down ? Children can ' t even guarantee that with backyard model rockets. Will officials pull a Christo and blanket the entire surroundings in fire-retardant material ? President Trump  s language indicates a key American tradition has been rekindled in this fireworks show. But the annual fireworks at Mount Rushmore only began in 1998 , and they were discontinued in 2009 due to even higher fire risk after an infestation of tree-weakening beetles. At that time , investigators also found dangerously high levels of chemicals in the groundwater where the fireworks were launched. In 1988 , a wildfire caused by lightning and similarly dry conditions caused an emergency evacuation of 2,000 tourists at Mount Rushmore. The fireworks show is expected to draw about 7,500 spectators , all of whom would be surrounded by the same trees that could be involved in a fire event.

But the rest of us may be wondering why LA  s turning a massive water source into a goth-looking PlayPlace. The answer ? To keep the drought-stricken area  s water clean and protect it from evaporation. Advertisement On Monday , LA mayor Eric Garcetti dumped 20,000 so-called shade balls  into the Los Angeles Reservoir. It  s the final stage of that city  s water quality protection plan , an effort costing $ 34.5 million. A shade ball , which sounds like it could be a Pokemon move , is actually a clever water-cleaning device : Each one reduces evaporation , protects against animals and dirt , and costs a mere 36 cents. A total of 96 million have been poured into the 175-acre reservoir , which holds up to 3.3 billion gallons of water. LA is the first city to use this type of innovation for water quality control. Shade balls are also useful for staving off algae growth and preventing harmful chemical reactions between sunlight and chlorine. In a press release , the city claims shade balls are a cost-effective way to reduce evaporation each year by nearly 300 million gallons , enough to provide drinking water for 8,100 people for a full year.  The onyx-colored buoyant ball pit joins other inventive anti-drought measures that have popped up in recent years : One startup is helping farmers install sensors that read soil levels and tell farmers when to judiciously irrigate , for example. Meanwhile , this handheld fog catcher scoops moisture out of the air and voila : Water for your coffee. Up next , the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is getting ready to open a $ 100 million ultraviolet water treatment facility that it says will keep LA water safe and help cut losses. In the meantime , we  ll see if the army of li  l plastic balls keeps the drought at bay.

Los Angeles is about to find out. On Monday , Mayor Eric Garcetti was at the Los Angeles Reservoir to mark the addition of 20,000 of the small balls to the lake. The Department of Water and Power proclaimed in a statement that it is the first utility company to use this technology for water quality protection .... The small , black plastic balls protect water quality by preventing sunlight-triggered chemical reactions , deterring birds and other wildlife , and protecting water from rain and wind-blown dust.

Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >> Advertisement Some other facts about the balls from the DWP : -- Each ball comes fully assembled and costs 36 cents. -- The balls are expected to save $ 250 million compared to other means to comply with clean-water laws. -- The balls are also expected to save 300 million gallons of water otherwise lost to evaporation. -- The shade balls are designed to last for 10 years. They are made from high-density polyethylene , which is the same material you would find in a 1-gallon milk carton. The balls are OK to come into contact with drinking water. According to the DWP , they do not emit or leach any chemicals.  However , they will eventually lose their structural integrity and may split in half. -- Two vendors provided the balls. XavierC LLC ( based in Glendora ) produced 6.4 million of the balls. Artisan Screen Printing ( based on Artisan Screen Printing ) provided 89.6 million. Together , the balls cost DWP $ 34.5 million. That comes to 36 cents apiece. -- The balls specifically protect the water from chemical reactions that may cause algae to bloom.

60,"( CNN )  Getting excited about gathering for America ' s most anticipated holiday meal ? First , you have to get there. And with winter watches , warnings and advisories lined up from California to Michigan , many people may experience travel delays. A record 31.6 million passengers will travel on US airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday period , according to a forecast by Airlines For America , an US airline trade organization. That ' s up 3.7 % from last year. Sunday , December 1 is expected to be the busiest travel day ever for the US airline industry , with 3.1 million passengers expected that day , according to the organization ' s estimates The second-busiest day of the holiday period will be Wednesday , November 27 , with 2.98 million people flying the day before Thanksgiving. The best day to fly ? It ' s Thanksgiving Day , with just 1.79 million people flying on the actual holiday. The forecast translates to an average of 2.63 million passengers per day -- up 93,000 passengers per day from a year ago. The airline organization defines the Thanksgiving travel season as starting on Friday , November 22 and wrapping up Tuesday , December 3.

Bring extra water and snacks in case you ' re stuck in traffic or your car battery conks out and you need to wait for help. Flares and a flashlight. If you do need assistance , a fully charged cell phone , backup cell phone battery , flares and a flashlight can help light the way. Stay warm. If your car won ' t run , neither will the heat. Pack warm coats and blankets to keep warm if you ' re stuck on the side of the road. Flying with patience Flying can be faster -- and more frustrating -- for holiday travel. About 26.8 million passengers are expected to pass through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints nationwide from the Friday before Thanksgiving through the Monday afterward , or November 22 to December 2 , according to TSA Acting Deputy Administrator Patricia Cogswell. That would be a record for the Thanksgiving period , "" probably the biggest Thanksgiving period in our entire history , "" Cogswell said at a recent press conference at Washington Reagan National Airport. It ' s important for travelers to know ahead of time what needs to be checked and what can be brought aboard aircraft , Cogswell said. That information is available online at TSA.gov TSA is also reminding travelers during the holiday crush that new REAL ID identification requirements are less than a year away. Beginning October 1 , 2020 , travelers 18 and older will need a REAL ID-compliant driver ' s license , state-issued enhanced driver ' s license or another acceptable form of ID to fly within the US. Our Thanksgiving guide to flying Patience and preparation will be key for fliers over the holiday period. Check your flight status. Check your flight status and get your mobile boarding passes or print outs ready at home. ( It doesn ' t matter if it ' s sunny at home if your aircraft is coming from Chicago and they ' re having a snowstorm. ) Load up on apps. Most airlines , many airports and the TSA all have apps you can use to check on flying conditions , aircraft status and even food for sale. Some airlines let you rebook on their apps. Get to the airport early. If you clear the lines to check your bags and clear security early , there ' s more time to read or play with electronics , do yoga or talk to your traveling companions. Check TSA requirements in advance. Figure out what you can carry on and what has to be packed in checked luggage. It ' s all listed Figure out what you can carry on and what has to be packed in checked luggage. It ' s all listed online at TSA.gov Pack snacks. The lines at your favorite airport eatery are going to be long , so have some snacks ready to eat , especially if you ' re facing a super-long TSA line. Prepare your kids. That could mean bringing enough diapers , snacks and wipes or having enough shows loaded up on electronic devices to keep them busy. Pack your jellies. Eggnog , maple syrup , preserves and jellies need to go into checked bags. ( With a checked bag , you can pack ALL of your crazy sweaters. ) Have a disability ? Call TSA. Travelers with disabilities or medical conditions and their families can call the TSA Cares helpline toll free at 855-787-2227 at least 72 hours prior to flying to ask questions about screening policies and get assistance at checkpoints. What else do you need ? Noise-cancelling headphones , a sleep pillow and a charged battery for your gadgets ? Bring them all .|||||Flying somewhere for Thanksgiving ? Good luck.

Published Thursday in Science , a review of recent studies says ocean temperatures are more in sync with dire climate model simulations than scientists knew.

The studies rely on a network of floats measuring ocean temperatures around the world ; the so-called Argo network , developed in the early 2000s , is considered better than the old method of ships dropping sensors into the ocean by copper wire , per the New York Times. story continues below A fourth study measures ocean temperatures differently  by looking at oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , per an October Times article  but also concurs with climate models.

The authors of the report , which the Pentagon delivered to Congress on Thursday , note that it probably underestimates the full extent of risk to military facilities because it only looks at likely impacts over the next two decades. The UN ' s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the world needs to become carbon neutral by 2050 to prevent global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius , which would lock in many of the most catastrophic effects of climate change. It is relevant to point out that future  in this analysis means only 20 years in the future ,  the report said.

The Pentagon report focused on 79 installations across the armed services. It said 53 installations currently experience recurrent flooding , 43 face drought , 36 are exposed to wildfires , six are undergoing desertification and one is dealing with thawing permafrost. More installations will feel those climate stressors in the future , with 60 sites projected to see recurrent flooding , 48 confronted hurt by drought and 43 threatened at risk of wildfires. Democrats were disappointed that the report lacked specifics they said were required by law , such as cost estimates to upgrade installations to ensure they can withstand the effects of climate change. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith ( D-Wash. ) called it "" inadequate "" and Rep. Jim Langevin ( D-R.I. ) , who sponsored the amendment to the Defense authorization bill requiring the report , labeled it "" cursory "" and questioned why only U.S. military installations were considered. "" While this climate report acknowledges that nearly all the military installations it studied are vulnerable to major climate change impacts , and provides numerous installation-level examples of those impacts , it fails to even minimally discuss a mitigation plan to address the vulnerabilities , "" Smith said in a statement. The report builds on a number of other Pentagon reports that have called climate change a threat multiplier  that can alter DOD priorities , such as mass migration and humanitarian aid missions fueled by extreme weather events. The fingerprints of climate change can disrupt everyday military operations , the report said. Due to routine training and testing activities that are significant ignition sources , wildfires are a constant concern on many military installations ,  the report said. As a result , the DoD spends considerable resources on claims , asset loss , and suppression activities due to wildfire.  Installations such as Norfolk Naval Base face persistent vulnerabilities like sea-level rise. Others have sustained damage from extreme events made more intense by climate change , such as Tyndall Air Force Base , near Panama City , Fla. , which was pummeled last year by Hurricane Michael , the strongest storm to ever hit the panhandle. The Pentagon said it needs "" to better understand rates of coastal erosion , natural and built flood protection infrastructure , and inland and littoral flood planning and mitigation. "" And it is honing its research to improve projections for sea-level rise , storm surge and inland flooding as well as exploring better materials and designs for buildings and infrastructure. DOD has taken measures to bolster bases against climate change , the report said , including by integrating climate change scenarios into planning and updating design standards. It is also conducting research on drought risk to installations in the Southwest , investigating how thawing permafrost will affect Arctic operations and has developed a fire science strategy in response to wildfire vulnerabilities. The military also is partnering with foreign nations to blunt the effects of climate change. Those partnerships include ensuring water security in the Chad Basin and Tanzania ; a water workshop in the Czech Republic ; and an Arctic mission analysis with Scandinavian nations. Climate change has contributed to country instability issues ,  where rainy season flooding and desertification in Africa as well as flooding in the Pacific region have stressed military missions , it said ."
62,"Four urban sections of the San Andreas Fault system in Northern California have stored enough energy to produce major earthquakes , according to a new study that measures fault creep. Three fault sections  Hayward , Rodgers Creek and Green Valley  are nearing or past their average recurrence interval , according to the study published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America ( BSSA ) . The earthquake cycle reflects the accumulation of strain on a fault , its release as slip , and its re-accumulation and re-release. Fault creep is the slip and slow release of strain in the uppermost part of the Earth ' s crust that occurs on some faults between large earthquakes , when much greater stress is released in only seconds. Where no fault creep occurs , a fault is considered locked and stress will build until it is released by an earthquake. This study estimates how much creep occurs on each section of the San Andreas Fault system in Northern California. Enough creep on a fault can diminish the potential size of its next earthquake rupture. "" The extent of fault creep , and therefore locking , controls the size and timing of large earthquakes on the Northern San Andreas Fault system , "" said James Lienkaemper , a co-author of the study and research geophysicist at U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) . "" The extent of creep on some fault sections is not yet well determined , making our first priority to study the urban sections of the San Andreas , which is directly beneath millions of Bay Area residents. "" Understanding the amount and extent of fault creep directly impacts seismic hazard assessments for the region. The San Andreas Fault system in Northern California consists of five major branches that combine for a total length of approximately 1250 miles. Sixty percent of the fault system releases energy through fault creep , ranging from 0.1 to 25.1 mm ( .004 to 1 inch ) per year , and about 28 percent remains locked at depth , according to the authors. Monitoring of creep on Bay Area faults has expanded in recent years. The alignment array measurements made by the San Francisco State University Creep Project and recently expanded GPS station networks provide the primary data on surface creep , which the authors used to estimate the average depth of creep for each fault segment. Where available , details of past ruptures of individual faults , unearthed in previous paleoseismic studies , allowed the authors to calculate recurrence rates and the probable timing and size of future earthquakes. According to the study , four faults have accumulated sufficient strain to produce a major earthquake. Three creeping faults have large locked areas ( less than 1 mm or .04 inches of creep per year ) that have not ruptured in a major earthquake of at least magnitude 6.7 since the reporting of earthquakes by local inhabitants : Rodgers Creek , northern Calaveras and southern Green Valley. The southern Hayward fault , which produced a magnitude 6.8 earthquake in 1868 , is now approaching its mean recurrence time based on paleoseismic studies. The authors also estimate three faults appear to be nearing or have exceeded their mean recurrence time and have accumulated sufficient strain to produce large earthquakes : the Hayward ( M 6.8 ) , Rodgers Creek ( M 7.1 ) and Green Valley ( M 7.1 ) . "" The San Andreas Fault and its two other large branches , the Hayward and Northern Calaveras , have been quiet for decades. This study offers a good reminder to prepare today for the next major earthquake , "" said Lienkaemper .|||||Several faults underlying urban areas in the San Francisco Bay Area may be primed for a major rupture that could lead to a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake , new data suggest. Sections of the Hayward , Rodgers Creek and Green Valley faults are nearing or past their average earthquake recurrence intervals , according to the study published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. The faults appear to be locked , unable to accommodate the inexorable movement of the Pacific Plate past the North American Plate , and that means it  s only a matter of time before one of those stuck segments gives way , producing a large earthquake , says the study  s lead author , Jim Lienkaemper , a research geophysicist at the U. S. Geological Survey. In fact , there  s a nearly 70 percent chance that one of them will rupture within the next 30 years , Lienkaemper says. Of the four fault segments most likely to break within the next 30 years , the Hayward fault is of most concern. The Hayward Fault is the one that affects the most people and infrastructure ,  Lienkaemper says. But a rupture on any of the others could also have devastating effects , potentially disrupting drinking water supplies by damaging the tunnel between the East and West Bay as well as between the northern and southern parts of the state. "" A large earthquake on the Hayward Fault would affect the entire San Francisco Bay Area  over 5 million people , "" says Greg Beroza , the Wayne Loel Professor of Earth Sciences in the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University , who was no associated with the study. "" Damage would likely be most severe near the fault in the East Bay , but there are areas removed from the fault , including the entire periphery of San Francisco Bay , and the Sacramento Delta , that would be very strongly shaken as well. "" A USGS report in 2008 suggested that a major earthquake on the Hayward Fault would cause "" hundreds of deaths , leave thousands homeless , and devastate the region  s economy. "" Lienkaemper and his colleagues combined information on the recent behavior of faults in the Bay Area with what is known about past earthquake histories in a model that spotlighted the segments most likely to rupture in the near future. In a process earth scientists have dubbed creep ,  large sections of the San Andreas system grind quietly past one another without producing any ground shaking. But fault segments in the Bay Area appear to be stuck , displaying very little creep. The only way for these locked and slowly creeping segments to catch up with the movement on the rest of the fault is to break suddenly in a major earthquake.

That movement will eventually push the Los Angeles region , which is on the Pacific Plate , up alongside San Francisco but that won  t be for millions of years. In contrast , three of the fault segments discussed in the paper are creeping at less than 1 mm per year. The movement on all these faults has to add up to the plate boundary rate ,  Lienkaemper says. The Pacific Plate is having its way with the North American Plate and each fault has an assumed slip rate. But the locked patches are resisting.  Scientists have determined how often the faults have ruptured by digging trenches in the fault zones and cataloguing the size and timing of each historical event. Take the Hayward Fault , for example. A section ruptured in 1868 , producing a magnitude 6.8 earthquake. Trenching studies have shown that section ruptures roughly every 160 years. Lienkaemper and his colleagues have estimated the size of the next earthquake on the three segments that are near to or have exceeded their average recurrence time : the Hayward , a magnitude 6.8 , the Rodgers Creek , 7.1 and the Green Valley , 7.1. For comparison , the Loma Prieta earthquake , which badly shook the Bay Area 25 years ago this month , leading to 63 deaths , was a magnitude 6.9. No one knows exactly why certain sections of the fault lock up. It  s possible that bumps and crevices on the surfaces that need to slide by one another jam it up , says Arthur Lerner-Lam , a research professor and deputy director of Columbia University  s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory , who was not involved with the study. A lot has to do with whether there are bends in the fault trace   zigs and zags that can hang the fault up until enough pressure builds to break through. Experts say they hope the new study will energize individuals , governments and businesses to retrofit older structures to make them safer. Homes , for example , should be bolted to their foundations. Structures made from rigid substances like brick or concrete need to be reinforced. What [ these researchers ] find is that four faults are loaded to near failure ,  says Ralph Archuleta , professor emeritus at the University of California , Santa Barbara. What this tells you is that within your lifetime there is a high likelihood that you will experience a significant earthquake with shaking as violent as in Napa and perhaps more violent if one of these goes. And the duration of strong shaking will be longer.  That  s because a longer length of fault will be unzipped ,  Archuleta says. The larger the area that slips in an earthquake , the longer the time it will generate seismic waves that rattle and roar through and across the ground. The purpose [ of a study like this ] is to further reinforce the notion that California is earthquake country ,  Lerner-Lam says. And proper precautions should be made for an eventual earthquake.  The recent Napa Valley earthquake might have helped nudge Northern California residents out of their complacency. But Archuleta worries that people will still ignore the new warning because of the forecast ' s long-range nature  30 years  and procrastinate on the upgrades needed to make their homes more earthquake resilient. People need to realize that this doesn  t mean you  re safe for 30 years , he says. What they need to think about is that it could happen tomorrow or a week from tomorrow ,  he explains. We don  t know when , but we do know that inevitably there will be an earthquake . "

64,"Officials warned Sunday evening that a wildfire continues to grow  as firefighters combat tough terrain and fire-spreading winds in northern Colorado  just one of several blazes threatening residents in the western U.S. New evacuations were ordered for the High Park fire 15 miles west of Fort Collins in the Crystal Mountain area. The burning pattern of High Park fire could potentially cut off exit routes for residents in this area and they should leave now ,  authorities said on an official website for tracking the fire response. About 2,200 evacuation notices have been given since Saturday , and 18 buildings have been damaged or destroyed. Advertisement Officials suspect lightning caused the fire , which affected just two acres on Saturday morning until strong winds quickly fanned it into a 14,000-acre inferno by Sunday evening. The fire sent up heavy smoke , obscuring the sun and creating an eerie , orange dusk in the middle of the day , according to the Associated Press. The smell drifted into the Denver area and smoke spread as far away as central Nebraska , western Kansas and Texas. A Colorado wolf sanctuary was forced to evacuate 11 wolves , the Associated Press reported. Nineteen more wolves remained at the sanctuary , which has underground bunkers to shelter animals during fires , KUSA-TV in Denver reported. The new wildfire has officials worried about resources getting stretched too thin , with other fires in Wyoming ( now facing a 8,493-acre blaze being fought by 405 personnel ) and New Mexico ( 278,039 acres for the Whitewater-Baldy Complex fire , 644 personnel ; 26,000 acres for the Little Bear fire , 144 personnel ) . We  re definitely competing with fires in New Mexico and other areas ,  Nick Christensen , an executive officer with the Larimer County Sheriff  s Office , told the Denver Post. The Whitewater-Baldy Complex fire in New Mexico , now 37 % contained under incredibly difficult firefighting terrain and dry weather conditions , has almost doubled the old record for the largest fire in New Mexico history , which used to be 156,593 acres. Another New Mexico fire , near the mountain community of Ruidoso , is considered a bigger threat because it  s closer to more homes , officials told the Associated Press ; they estimated a few hundred people had evacuated Ruidoso and encouraged Capitan , N.M. , residents to get ready to leave if necessary. Any communities around this fire have the potential of being evacuated ,  Karen Takai , a spokeswoman for the Ruidoso fire crews , told the Associated Press. If I lived in Capitan , I definitely would be prepared. Don  t wait until the sheriff  s office comes knocking at your door and tells you to evacuate.  The Colorado High Park fire has not been contained by the 250 personnel now fighting it , and officials say it has a high growth potential in the rough land around High Park , which is filled with trees killed by bark beetles. As of 5 a.m. Sunday , officials had evacuated highways and canyons around the fire and reported more evacuations for the areas south and west of Bellvue , including Lory State Park , Red Stone Canyon and Buckhorn Road from Masonville up to Stove Prairie School. Kathie Walter and her husband helped friends several miles away evacuate from the Colorado fire Saturday , according to an Associated Press report. When they got home , they were surprised to get a call warning them to be ready to evacuate just in case. But Walter didn  t want to wait. Smoke was coming in hard ,  Kathie Walter told the Associated Press. We could not see flames or orange or black smoke. But we didn  t need to see anymore. We just said , Hey , let  s get out of here.  "
65,"A magnitude 4.5 earthquake was felt widely in the San Francisco Bay Area at 10 : 33 p.m. Monday , with the epicenter in the Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill areas. Moderate shaking was felt in the Pleasant Hill , Walnut Creek and Concord areas , an intensity that can overturn unsecured objects , such as books and picture frames , and is capable of breaking dishes or windows. Weak shaking was felt in San Francisco , Oakland and San Jose , according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Close to the epicenter in Walnut Creek , there was strong side-to-side shaking , strong enough to knock CDs off a shelf. The USGS said there was a 2 % chance of one or more aftershocks larger than magnitude 4.5 over the next week , and as many as four aftershocks of magnitude 3 or higher. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time , but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again , temporarily ,  the USGS said in its aftershock forecast. Advertisement Through the morning , there were several small afterschocks ; the largest was 2.1 magnitude. Based on the observed shaking intensity recorded by the USGS , scientists said they didn  t expect there to be major structural damage. The earthquake had a preliminary depth of about 9 miles , fairly deep for this part of the world , Keith Knudsen , USGS geologist and deputy director of the agency  s Earthquake Science Center , said in an interview. The depth of the quake caused it to be felt over a broad area , but the shaking felt at the surface was less intense than if the quake had been more shallow , scientists said. The earthquake was not directly on top of any of the main Bay Area earthquake faults. The epicenter was about three miles west of the Concord fault , and farther than that off the northern end of the northern Calaveras fault , Knudsen said. The epicenter is just northwest of Mt. Diablo , one of the Bay Area  s tallest peaks. The Mt. Diablo area is also a seismically active zone , a region of uplift , folding and thrusting ,  said David Schwartz , USGS scientist emeritus. There were a series of earthquakes in the magnitude 5 range on the southeast side of Mt. Diablo in 1980 in the Greenville fault area. On Jan. 26 , 1980 , a magnitude 5.4 quake hit with an epicenter only six miles from downtown Livermore. Damage in 1980 was reported at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a mobile home park. The Concord-Green Valley and Calaveras faults are among the Bay Area  s most significant. Strong shaking from a hypothetical magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Concord-Green Valley fault is capable of causing strong shaking in Contra Costa , Solano and Napa counties , and cause damage to the Kinder Morgan Concord pumping station , responsible for pumping fuel across the northern half of California , the Assn. of Bay Area Governments said in a report published in 2014. The Calaveras fault can produce a quake in the magnitude 7 range , and it  s possible that it could rupture jointly with the Hayward fault , one of the nation  s most dangerous because the Hayward fault runs directly underneath densely populated cities in the East Bay , like Oakland , Berkeley , Hayward and Fremont. Near the epicenter , it seemed the worst impact was residents shaken from sleep. At Farrington  s Sports Bar in Pleasant Hill , about 20 patrons were playing pool and darts and watching TV when the earthquake started. Bartender Casey Ashimine said no bottles broke but it was definitely apparent that they were experiencing an earthquake. A good little shaker ,  Ashimine said. A couple people looked around , but nobody freaked out.  Assistant Chief Chris Bachman of the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District , which provides emergency services to communities close to the quake  s epicenter , said that as of about 11 p.m. , there were no reports of injuries or property damage related to the earthquake. The earthquake occurred just three days before the 30th anniversary of the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake , which killed 63 people in Northern California. In the last 10 days , there have been two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater centered nearby. An average of 25 earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.0 and 5.0 occur each year in California and Nevada , according to a recent three-year data sample. Did you feel this earthquake ?

66,"Humankind is no match for the wrath of Mother Nature when it comes to these deadly natural disasters. Every year , nearly 100,000 people perish in natural disasters  earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , hurricanes , tsunamis , floods , wildfires and droughts  while over 150 million are impacted by them , worldwide , according to the World Health Organization. Violent natural disasters have been a fact of human life since the beginning of mankind , but the death counts of the most ancient of these disasters are lost to history. The ancient Mediterranean island of Thera ( now Santorini , Greece ) , for example , experienced a catastrophic volcanic eruption that eradicated the entire Minoan civilization around 1600 B.C. , according to a 2020 study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences. But exactly how many lives were lost ? We ' ll never know. Related : Live Science podcast "" Life ' s Little Mysteries "" 5 : Mysterious volcanoes However , thanks to historical records and journals , historians can at least estimate the number of fatalities linked to disasters that occured in the common era. According to such records , the following natural disasters are the deadliest of all time , ranked from lowest to highest estimated death toll. ( For those disasters for which a death toll range is given , the disaster is ranked by the highest end of the estimate. ) 10. ( TIE ) The A.D. 1138 Aleppo earthquake The view across the amphitheater of The Citadel in Aleppo , Syria. ( Image credit : Nicholas Prins/Getty Images ) On Oct. 11 , 1138 , the ground under the Syrian city of Aleppo began to shake. The city sits on the confluence of the Arabian and African plates , making it prone to temblors , but this one was particularly violent. The magnitude of the quake is lost to time , but contemporary chroniclers reported that the city ' s citadel collapsed and houses crumbled across Aleppo. The resulting death toll is estimated at around 230,000 , but that figure comes from the 15th century , and the historian who reported it may have conflated the Aleppo quake with one that occurred in what is now the modern-day Eurasian country of Georgia , according to a 2004 paper in the journal Annals of Geophysics. Still , this supposed death toll ties this event as the 10th most deadly natural disaster of all time. 10. ( TIE ) The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami Aerial view of destruction caused by the 2004 tsunami that hit Indonesia. ( Image credit : CHOO YOUN-KONG/Getty Images ) Tied for 10th place is a catastrophic magnitude 9.1 earthquake that struck undersea off the west coast of Sumatra , Indonesia , on Dec. 26 , 2004. The quake created a massive tsunami that killed approximately 230,000 , and displaced nearly 2 million people in 14 South Asian and East African countries. Traveling as fast as 500 mph ( 804 kph ) , the tsunami reached land in as little as 15 to 20 minutes after the quake hit , giving residents little time to flee to higher ground. In some places , especially hardest-hit Indonesia , the tsunami wave reached over 100 feet ( 30 meters ) high , according to World Vision , a humanitarian aid organization. Related : Tsunami science : Advances since the 2004 Indian Ocean tragedy Damages from the earthquake and tsunami are estimated at $ 10 billion dollars.

( Image credit : Bettmann/Getty Images ) At 3 : 42 a.m. on July 28 , 1976 , the Chinese city of Tangshan was razed to the ground by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake , according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) . Tangshan , an industrial city with a population of about 1 million at the time of the disaster , suffered staggering casualties of over 240,000. While this was the official death toll , some experts suggest this number is grossly underestimated and that the loss of life was likely closer to 700,000. Reportedly , 85 % of Tangshan ' s buildings collapsed , and trembles were felt in Beijing , China , more than 100 miles ( 180 km ) away. It took several years before the city of Tangshan was rebuilt to its prior glory. 8. The A.D. 526 Antioch earthquake 1890 drawing of the "" Approach to Antioch , "" a center of early Christianity. Artist unknown. ( Image credit : Hulton Archive/Getty Images ) As with all disasters occurring millenia ago , a precise death toll for the Antioch earthquake is hard to come by. Contemporary chronicler John Malalas wrote at the time that about 250,000 people died when the temblor hit the Byzantine Empire city ( now Turkey and Syria ) in May , 526. Malalas attributed the disaster to the wrath of God and reported that fires destroyed everything in Antioch that the earthquake did not. According to a 2007 paper in The Medieval History Journal , the death toll was higher than it would have been at other times of the year because the city was full of tourists celebrating Ascension Day  the Christian feast that commemorates Jesus ' ascension into heaven. 7. The 1920 Haiyuan earthquake "" The Haiyuan earthquake was the largest quake recorded in China in the 20th century with the highest magnitude and intensity , "" Deng Qidong , a geologist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences , said during a seminar in 2010. Related : How are earthquakes measured ? The earthquake , which struck north central China ' s Haiyuan County on Dec. 16 , 1920 , also rocked the neighboring Gansu and Shaanxi Provinces. It was reportedly a 7.8 on the Richter scale , however , China today claims it was of magnitude 8.5. There are also discrepancies in the number of lives lost. The USGS reported total casualties of 200,000 , but according to a 2010 study by Chinese seismologists , the death toll could have been as high as 273,400. The region ' s high deposits of loess soils ( porous , silty sediment that ' s very unstable ) triggered massive landslides which were responsible for over 30,000 of these deaths , according to a 2020 study published in the journal Landslides. 6.

The hurricane ' s wind speeds and category are not known , as is the case for many storms that took place before the 20th century. About 20,000 ships and vessels were destroyed , along with the lives of an estimated 300,000 people. 6.

( Image credit : ERIKA SANTELICES/Getty Images ) The catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti just northwest of Port-au-Prince on Jan. 12 , 2010 , ranks as one of the three deadliest quakes of all time. Related : Haiti could be in new earthquake cycle , scientists say Haiti ' s standing as one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere and its limited history of large earthquakes left it extremely vulnerable to damages and loss of life. As many as 3 million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates were all over the place ; initially , the government of Haiti estimated fatalities stood at 230,000 people , but in January 2011 , officials revised that figure to 316,000. A 2010 study published in the journal Medicine , Conflict and Survival put the number at around 160,000 deaths , while the USGS claimed even lower numbers  around 100,000. These disparities reflect the difficulty of counting deaths even in the modern era , not to mention the political wrangling that goes on over "" official "" numbers. 4. The 1970 Bhola cyclone Villagers walk through a field of dead cattle and search for rice and other grains to salvage , near Sonapur , East Pakistan ( later Bangladesh ) , in the aftermath of the massive cyclone and accompanying tidal wave that slammed the area in November 1970. ( Image credit : Larry Burrows/Getty Images ) This tropical cyclone hit what is now Bangladesh ( then East Pakistan ) on Nov. 12-13 , 1970. According to NOAA ' s Hurricane Research Division , the storm ' s strongest wind speeds measured 130 mph ( 205 kph ) , making it the equivalent of a Category 4 major hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale. Ahead of its landfall , a 35-foot ( 10.6 m ) storm surge washed over the low-lying islands bordering the Bay of Bengal , causing widespread flooding. Related : Monster cyclone in India prompts the biggest evacuation in the country ' s history The storm surge , combined with a lack of evacuation , resulted in a massive death toll estimated at 300,000 to 500,000 people. A 1971 report from the National Hurricane Center and the Pakistan Meteorological Department acknowledged the challenge of accurately estimating the death toll , especially due to the influx of seasonal workers who were in the area for the rice harvest. As of the writing of this article , the Bhola cyclone is considered the deadliest tropical cyclone on record , according to the World Meteorological Organization. And it caused an estimated $ 86 billion in damages. 3. The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake The deadliest earthquake in history hit China ' s Shaanxi province on Jan. 23 , 1556. Known as the "" Jiajing Great Earthquake "" after the emperor whose reign it occurred in , the temblor reduced a 621-square-mile ( 1,000 square kilometers ) swath of the country to rubble , according to the Science Museums of China. An estimated 830,000 people died as their yaodong  cave homes carved into the region ' s loess plateaus  collapsed. The exact magnitude of the quake is lost to history , but modern-day geophysicists estimate it at around magnitude 8. 2. The 1887 Yellow River flood The flow of China ' s Yellow River is now closely monitored and controlled to help prevent flooding. This aerial photo taken on July 19 , 2020 shows water released from the Xiaolangdi Reservoir Dam in Luoyang in China ' s central Henan province , in preparation of the upcoming annual flood season at the Yellow River basin. ( Image credit : STR/Getty Images ) The Yellow River ( Huang He ) in China was precariously situated far above most of the land around it in the late 1880s , thanks to a series of dikes built to contain the river as it flowed through the farmland of central China. Over time , these dikes had silted up , gradually lifting the river in elevation. When heavy rains swelled the river in September 1887 , it spilled over these dikes into the surrounding low-lying land , inundating 5,000 square miles ( 12,949 square km ) , according to "" Encyclopedia of Disasters : Environmental Catastrophes and Human Tragedies "" ( Greenwood Publishing Group , 2008 ) . As a result of this flood , an estimated 900,000 to 2 million people lost their lives. 1. The 1931 Yangtze River floods This aerial photo taken on July 28 , 2020 shows a flooded sports ground along the Yangtze River in Wuhan in China ' s central Hubei province. In 1931 , the Yangtze River flooded almost 70,000 square miles ( 180,000 square km ) and killed at least 2 million people. ( Image credit : STR/Getty Images ) Excessive rainfall over central China in July and August of 1931 triggered the most deadly natural disaster in world history  the Central China floods of 1931. The Yangtze River overtopped its banks as spring snowmelt mingled with the over 24 inches ( 600 millimeters ) of rain that fell during the month of July alone. ( The Yellow River and other large waterways also reached high levels. ) According to "" The Nature of Disaster in China : The 1931 Yangzi River Flood "" ( Cambridge University Press , 2018 ) , the flood inundated almost 70,000 square miles ( 180,000 square km ) and turned the Yangtze into what looked like a giant lake or ocean. Contemporary government numbers put the number of dead at around 2 million , but other agencies , including NOAA , say it may have been as many as 3.7 million people.

The world map might look differently had the Greek volcano Thera not erupted 3,500 years ago in what geologists believe was the single-most powerful explosive event ever witnessed. Thera didn ' t just blow a massive hole into the island of Santorini  it set the entire ancient Mediterranean onto a different course , like a train that switched tracks to head off in a brand new direction. Minoan culture , the dominant civilization in the Mediterranean at the time , crumbled as a result of the eruption , historians believe , changing the political landscape of the ancient world indefinitely. Environmental effects were felt across the globe , as far away as China and perhaps even North America and Antarctica. The legend of Atlantis and the story of the Biblical plagues and subsequent exodus from Egypt have also been connected to the epic catastrophe. Dwarfed the atomic bomb Historians and archaeologists have had trouble deciding on the year Thera erupted , with dates ranging anywhere from 1645 BC to 1500 BC. Studies of ash deposits on the ocean floor have revealed , however , that when the volcano did blow , it did so with a force dwarfing anything humans had ever seen or have seen since. There are no first-person accounts of what happened that day , but scientists can compare it to the detailed records available from the famous eruption of Krakatoa , Indonesia , in 1883. That fiery explosion killed upwards of 40,000 people in just a few hours , produced colossal tsunamis 40 feet tall , spewed volcanic ash across Asia , and caused a drop in global temperatures and created strangely colored sunsets for three years. The blast was heard 3,000 miles away. Thera ' s eruption was four or five times more powerful than Krakatoa , geologists believe , exploding with the energy of several hundred atomic bombs in a fraction of a second. An absence of human remains and valuables like metal suggest that the Minoan residents of Santorini predicted the eruption and the island was evacuated , but the culture as a whole did not fare as well. Based on the nearby island of Crete , the powerful Minoan civilization declined suddenly soon after Thera blew its top. Tsunamis spawned by the eruption would have swamped its naval fleet and coastal villages first off , historians think. A drop in temperatures caused by the massive amounts of sulphur dioxide spouted into the atmosphere then led to several years of cold , wet summers in the region , ruining harvests. The lethal combination overran every mighty Minoan stronghold in less than 50 years. In just a short time , their peaceful , efficient bureaucracy made way for the warring city-state system of ancient Greece to dominate the Mediterranean. The Aegean would turn out to be a fundamental building block for the history of Europe , and the Minoan decline changed its early foundation completely. Famous legends Thera didn ' t just alter the cultural make up of Europe , it has kept adventurers and treasure hunters busy too. When the Greek philosopher Plato described the lost city of Atlantis over a thousand years after the volcanic eruption , he may have been referring to Thera folklore passed down in Greece over many generations and exaggerated like a game of broken telephone. The eruption has also been loosely linked with the Biblical story of Moses and the exodus from Egypt. The effects of Thera ' s eruption could have explained many of the plagues described in the Old Testament , including the days of darkness and polluting of the rivers , according to some theories ."

68,"DUBAI ( Reuters ) - A fire tore through the intensive care unit and the maternity ward of a Saudi hospital before dawn on Thursday , killing at least 24 people and injuring 123 , officials said. A man receives treatment at Jazan General Hospital following a pre-dawn fire in the port city of Jazan , Saudi Arabia December 24 , 2015. REUTERS/Saudi Civil Defense/Handout via Reuters The fire broke out at the general hospital in the southwestern port city of Jazan , the capital of the Jizan region , one of Saudi Arabia  s poorest areas. The civil defense agency said 25 people died but a later statement by Health Minister Khalid al-Falih put the death toll at 24. Two of the dead were security guards and one was a child , officials said. Government-controlled al-Ekhbariya television interviewed a witness who said the cause of the fire seemed to be electrical , and that it took only three minutes to sweep through the hospital. We could hear the women screaming ,  said the man , who was not named. Photographs published on Twitter by the civil defense agency showed heavy smoke and an intense blaze which appeared to have severely damaged the interior of the white-walled hospital. Some rescuers used a ladder to gain access through a window. Criticism of Saudi Arabia  s ruling family is frowned upon , but a string of comments by Twitter users suggested the fire was the result of official negligence and criticized a series of accidents at public facilities in the kingdom this year. Slideshow ( 16 images ) Does the health minister have the courage to submit his resignation after the fire at Jazan General Hospital ? What disaster lies after this calamity ?  tweeted one person , whose account identified him as Mohammed Alsubaie , from Riyadh. A correspondent for Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television reported he had seen several emergency doors locked with chains when he visited the hospital after the disaster. He said the hospital had previously received official warnings over safety violations. The region  s Director of Health Affairs , Ahmed al-Sahli , denied any safety problems , telling al-Arabiya that many people had been able to escape easily from the blaze because the doors were open and safety equipment was in place. But Eissa Amaish , whose sister was killed in the fire , blamed the hospital  s management. What happened in this hospital was a crime of murder ,  he told al-Arabiya. This hospital was not equipped at all to deal with a fire.  In a brief statement , Falih said he recognized the ministry had failed , but that it was too early to identify the causes of the disaster and a committee would investigate them. When we have deaths like this number , there is no doubt that there is a failure in the system of the ministry of health , and we would like to ensure that this will not occur again at any other hospital ,  he said. A deadly crush at the haj in Mecca in September killed 769 people , according to Saudi officials. Reuters calculations based on numbers provided by the pilgrims  home countries showed the death toll was at least 2,070. Two weeks earlier , 110 people died in Mecca  s Grand Mosque when a crane working on an expansion project collapsed during a storm , crushing pilgrims below. In August , fire swept through an oil workers  residential compound in the town of Khobar , killing 10 people. Jazan , near the Yemeni border , is the focus of a $ 20 billion plan to develop the local economy by building an industrial complex that produces and uses oil products for manufacturing. The city has also been caught up in Saudi Arabia  s military intervention against Houthi rebels in Yemen this year. On Tuesday , Saudi authorities said they had shot down a ballistic missile fired from Yemen that was on a trajectory toward Jazan .|||||LONDON  Fire ravaged the maternity and neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital in Saudi Arabia early Thursday , killing at least 25 people and injuring more than 100 in the third mass calamity to hit the desert kingdom in the past four months.

Natalia Martinez , an Argentinian woman whose partner lives in Vancouver , was nine days into a solo climb of Mount Logan when the quakes hit on Monday , triggering multiple avalanches in her vicinity. The climber , who had been camping on a hanging glacier at an altitude of nearly 4,000 metres , quickly retreated partway down the mountain to more stable terrain. "" She was completely terrified , "" her boyfriend , Camilo Rada , told CTV News. "" She felt like the whole thing was going to collapse. "" Unfortunately , she has been trapped at that location ever since by a serious storm that hit the area. Icefield Discovery , the air touring company that dropped her off on the mountain , said Martinez is on a technical route that requires crampons and axes , and Monday ' s quakes left much of her surrounding area unstable.

Fortunately , both Williams and Rada believe Martinez is well-equipped to take care of herself. She ' s been in the area before on scientific expeditions , and has a good supply of food and fuel. Her partner , who is a PhD student at the University of British Columbia , said she was born in the foothills of Argentina ' s Aconcagua , the highest peak in the western and southern hemispheres , and likely the deadliest in South America. She worked on the mountain doing everything from managing base camp to guiding people to the summit , Rada said , and has roughly 15 years ' climbing experience altogether.

Everything you need to know about Nestl is here : brands , key figures , milestones .|||||Bottling water without scrutiny Miles from the nearest paved road in the San Bernardino National Forest , two sounds fill a rocky canyon : a babbling stream and the hissing of water flowing through a stainless steel pipe. From wells that tap into springs high on the mountainside , water gushes down through the pipe to a roadside tank. From there , it is transferred to tanker trucks , hauled to a bottling plant and sold as Arrowhead 100 % Mountain Spring Water. UPDATE : Groups seek fast ruling in suit to halt Nestle water use Nestle Waters North America holds a longstanding right to use this water from the national forest near San Bernardino. But the U.S. Forest Service hasn ' t been keeping an eye on whether the taking of water is harming Strawberry Creek and the wildlife that depends on it. In fact , Nestle ' s permit to transport water across the national forest expired in 1988. It hasn ' t been reviewed since , and the Forest Service hasn ' t examined the ecological effects of drawing tens of millions of gallons each year from the springs. Even with California deep in drought , the federal agency hasn ' t assessed the impacts of the bottled water business on springs and streams in two watersheds that sustain sensitive habitats in the national forest. The lack of oversight is symptomatic of a Forest Service limited by tight budgets and focused on other issues , and of a regulatory system in California that allows the bottled water industry to operate with little independent tracking of the potential toll on the environment. In an investigation of the industry ' s water footprint in the San Bernardino National Forest and other parts of California , The Desert Sun found that : No state agency is tracking exactly how much water is used by all of the bottled water plants in California , or monitoring the effects on water supplies and ecosystems statewide. The California Department of Public Health regulates 108 bottled water plants in the state , collecting information on water quality and the sources tapped. But the agency says it does not require companies to report how much water they use. That information , when collected piecemeal by state or local agencies , often isn ' t easily accessible to the public. In some cases , the amounts of water used are considered confidential and not publicly released. Even as Nestle Waters has been submitting required reports on its water use , the Forest Service has not been closely tracking the amounts of water leaving the San Bernardino National Forest and has not assessed the impacts on the environment. While the Forest Service has allowed Nestle to keep using an expired permit for nearly three decades , the agency has cracked down on other water users in the national forest. Several years ago , for instance , dozens of cabin owners were required to stop drawing water from a creek when their permits came up for renewal. Nestle has faced no such restrictions. Only this year , after a group of critics raised concerns in letters and after The Desert Sun inquired about the expired permit , did Forest Service officials announce plans to take up the issue and carry out an environmental analysis. A growing debate over Nestle ' s use of water from the San Bernardino National Forest parallels other arguments in places from the San Gorgonio Pass to Mount Shasta. And those debates have turned more contentious as a fourth year of drought weighs on California ' s depleted water supplies. Statewide , the bottled water industry accounts for a small fraction of overall water use. The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that roughly 1 percent of the water used in the state goes to industrial users , with bottling plants being a small portion of that. Pumping from wells can pull down groundwater levels , and drawing water from springs can reduce the amounts flowing in streams. Bottled water companies in California are typically subject to environmental reviews only when a permit for a new project triggers a formal study. Otherwise , the impacts of bottling plants on creeks and aquifers often aren ' t scrutinized by government agencies. In the San Bernardino National Forest , Nestle insists its bottling of spring water isn ' t causing any harm. Water from Arrowhead Springs has been tapped and sold for more than a century. The company says it is complying with all the requirements of its expired permit in the national forest and has been informed by the Forest Service that it can keep operating lawfully until a new permit is eventually issued. The company also says that at all of the springs where it draws water , it monitors the environment and manages its water use to ensure "" long-term sustainability. "" The Forest Service and Nestle have had a cooperative relationship over the years. In 2003 , the Old Fire swept through the area and destroyed portions of Nestle ' s pipeline. A month later , deadly floods and mudslides thundered down from the mountains. As Nestle workers rebuilt the pipeline on the mountainside , Forest Service officials oversaw the work. But the agency didn ' t require a new permit at the time , and in the years since hasn ' t examined whether draining away spring water poses problems for the creek and the forest. Two former Forest Service employees interviewed by The Desert Sun say they think it ' s wrong that the agency for decades hasn ' t studied the impacts on the national forest. During the drought , they say , there is now an urgent need to protect the water sources on public lands and reexamine Nestle ' s bottling operation. "" They ' re taking way too much water. That water ' s hugely important , "" said Steve Loe , a biologist who retired from the Forest Service in 2007. "" Without water , you don ' t have wildlife , you don ' t have vegetation. "" Standing on a roadside several miles from the springs , Loe motioned to the peaks in the distance , and to the steep mountainside where a natural rock formation shaped like an arrowhead marks the location of Arrowhead Springs. Beneath that arrowhead , hot springs bubble from the ground at a long-closed hotel that once attracted celebrities in the 1940s. In nearby Strawberry Canyon , cold springs gush from the mountain and into the pipes for bottling. "" When you take water from the springs that are the source of those waters , you dry up these canyons , "" Loe said. "" And they ' re the most important habitats that we have. "" An avid hiker and outdoorsman , Loe can rattle off a list of animals that need the water in Strawberry Creek : frogs , insects , salamanders , and birds such as Bell ' s vireo and willow flycatchers. An increasingly rare species of native fish , the Santa Ana speckled dace , used to survive in Strawberry Creek. Then , after the wildfire and floods of 2003 , the little fish disappeared from Strawberry Creek and other nearby streams. Scientists who surveyed the area concluded that the devastating fire and flooding had wiped out the populations. Loe said he suspects the bottling operation contributed to their demise by leaving few spots with enough water for them to survive through the summers. "" It makes everything in the stream more vulnerable having all of that water removed. "" Nestle disputes that and says its use of water didn ' t harm the fish. But Loe said siphoning off water that could otherwise flow in the creek poses clear threats that need to be fully studied , particularly in light of the drought and climate change. Loe first raised his concerns in an email in September to a list of federal and state officials and others , including a Nestle Waters manager. He pointed out that Nestle ' s permit "" has long expired and needs to be reissued , "" requiring an analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) . He suggested a meeting. Soon afterward , Loe met with the Nestle manager and laid out his concerns. Five months later  after he and others sent additional critical letters to the government and after The Desert Sun posed questions about the expired permit  Forest Service officials met with Loe and told him they have started to evaluate the reissuance of the expired permit. While pleased that the agency acknowledged the issue , Loe still has concerns. He wants to see an environmental study prepared by an independent third party. He also wants a review of Nestle ' s use of water from Deer Canyon Springs in the national forest. He said it ' s time for immediate measures to put more water into the streams while those environmental reviews , which can take years , are carried out. "" Because of the drought emergency , they need to go beyond just doing the NEPA , "" Loe said. "" I would like to see the Forest Service and Nestle agree not to take water until they know if it ' s OK to take water. This hasn ' t been studied in a long time. "" Ultimately , Loe said , protecting the flows of Strawberry Creek will likely require putting limits on how much water can be piped out. "" To keep taking water is just so risky if you care about the long-term health of that stream , "" he said. "" We should be sitting down with Nestle and we should be saying , ' We ' ve got to do something here. ' "" Bottling water from the national forest Tapping California springs and aquifers , bottled water companies face little scrutiny. Jay Calderon , The Desert Sun Strawberry Creek cascades down from the mountains in a rocky canyon filled with live oaks , white alder trees and poison oak. Often , the stream is narrow enough to jump across. Running alongside it is a 4-inch stainless steel pipe supported on metal scaffolding. "" That ' s Arrowhead ' s pipe coming down right there , "" said Gary Earney , a retired Forest Service employee , standing on the bank of the creek and leaning on a walking stick. Earney used to administer permits for the Forest Service , and he said the agency has never done an assessment of how the taking of water affects the creek. Back when the water pipes were installed in the early 20th century , he pointed out , no one conducted environmental reviews. Now , he said , it ' s long overdue. "" I ' m not opposed to the taking of water. But the water removed needs to be surplus to the needs of the national forest , "" Earney said. If the water is needed for wildlife , he said , it should instead be diverted at the national forest ' s boundary after it has flowed through the creek. Determining how much water is needed for a healthy ecosystem , he said , will require a thorough study. And that hasn ' t been done in all these years , he said , because the Forest Service lacks sufficient funding after repeated budget cuts and has a large backlog of expired permits. "" It ' s a national problem , "" Earney said. "" I think it ' s just improper management and poor funding. "" Walking among boulders , Earney said that if more water were allowed to flow in the creek , it would provide for plants and animals and would also sink into aquifers at the base of the mountains. "" We need to ensure that we have enough water to sustain the forest ' s health , "" Earney said. "" I think we should look at whether or not it ' s a more beneficial use of this water to be bottled and sold in small bottles , or to be allowed to go down and drain off the forest and recharge the groundwater. "" While Nestle ' s expired permit hasn ' t been scrutinized in nearly three decades , some other water users have been required to cut back. In the mid-2000s , as part of a regional review , the Forest Service went through the permits of hundreds of cabins on land in the national forest and reexamined their use of water from creeks. In Barton Flats , for instance , dozens of cabin owners were told they could no longer draw water from Barton Creek ; instead , they would have to use wells or install tanks and truck in water. Cabin owners spent thousands of dollars putting in tanks. "" Some of these people had been using the water with water rights for 80 years , and it was very costly to make the change. Nestle takes more water from the stream in one day than the total of all of those cabin owners in a year , "" Loe said. "" It ' s just so unfair. "" "" We made the little people do the right thing , "" he said , "" and we ' re not making the big people do the right thing. "" Amanda Frye , a community activist who lives in Redlands , said she finds the lack of oversight by the Forest Service disturbing , particularly during the drought. "" The U.S. government is just giving away our natural resources to an international corporation , "" Frye said. "" I think that ' s really wrong. "" Employees of the San Bernardino National Forest say they oversee about 1,500 permits for various uses of national forest lands , ranging from power lines to cabins. About 360 of those permits are expired , and officials say they are gradually working on the backlog. "" The Nestle permit is just one of those 360. It ' s not like we ' ve purposely held that one out , "" said Al Colby , a public services staff officer who oversees permits. "" The thing is that Nestle continues to pay the fee that they were charged back when the permit was still valid. "" Because of that , he said , the expired permit ' s conditions have remained in effect. "" Basically as long as they ' re paying the fee that was established before it expired , the permit is enforceable. "" The national forest has continued to collect a permit fee of $ 524 from Nestle Waters each year. The permit , granted to Nestle predecessor Arrowhead Puritas Waters , Inc. , was signed in 1978. An amendment said it would "" expire and become void "" in 1988. The permit allows the company to maintain more than 4 miles of water pipelines in the national forest , as well as horizontal wells that tap into the springs on the mountainside. Records show the water is drawn from a dozen spring sites , and flows through separate pipes before coming together in the single pipe that runs along Strawberry Creek. Forest Service officials said that in the 2000s there was talk of renewing Nestle ' s permit but that other priorities took precedence. Over the years , they said , those other priorities have included wildfires , forest thinning projects , a new rail line through Cajon Pass , and updating permits relating to Southern California Edison. In Southern California and elsewhere , backlogs of expired permits developed as the Forest Service underwent repeated budget cuts in the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s. The agency has also been burdened with the growing costs of fighting larger and more destructive wildfires , cutting into the amounts of money available for activities such as reviewing permits. Jason Collier , a lands and recreation specialist who handles special use permits , said he didn ' t know how much water Nestle has been using. He pointed out that when the permit was issued in the 1970s , reporting the volumes of water wasn ' t one of the conditions. "" If that tool was in the box , "" he said , "" then we could exercise it. "" Collier recalled that reissuing Nestle ' s expired permit was "" part of the discussion "" at one point  until the additional railroad track in Cajon Pass came up. "" Then the discussion became , ' There ' s a backlog in Long Beach ( port ) and we can ' t get our shipping containers moved. You work on the railroad , ' "" Collier said. "" That ' s our reality , right or wrong. "" Asked why the Forest Service reviewed the permits of more than 700 cabin owners while leaving Nestle ' s alone , Collier said that he couldn ' t speak to how the priorities were set but that the agency took up the cabin permits as part of a region-wide review. Now that the Forest Service is considering Nestle ' s permit , Colby said one of the agency ' s first steps was to request files from the company. "" We need whatever information they have , studies that they have about the area , whatever permit files that they ' ve got , "" Colby said. "" Once we look at all that information , plus our own permit file , that ' ll help us figure out the scope of what we need to be doing. "" Reissuing the permit likely will require studies to answer questions about how the water would flow if it weren ' t being extracted from the springs , said Robert Taylor , the forest hydrologist. Some of those questions , he said , include where a drop of water would otherwise go , whether it would in fact reach the creek , and how long its journey down the watershed would take. Taylor said he didn ' t have specifics of the amounts of water used from Arrowhead Springs because the information is collected by another agency tasked with that responsibility. Taylor said he hadn ' t looked at Nestle ' s use of water from Deer Canyon Springs either. "" We have a lot to do. There are a lot of expired permits. We get direction from the regional office and the Washington office on how to handle our levels of permits , "" Taylor said. "" I have 660,000 acres of the national forest to work on , and I ' m just one guy. When it becomes a priority , I ' ll deal with it. "" Nestle SA , headquartered in Vevey , Switzerland , is the world ' s largest food company. Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke has made headlines warning that water scarcity poses a major threat to food security around the world. Another influential figure on Nestle ' s board of directors is former U.N. Children ' s Fund Executive Director Ann Veneman , who was U.S. secretary of agriculture from 2001-2005 and oversaw the Forest Service under President George W. Bush. The company has invested heavily in expanding its bottled water business. Subsidiary Nestle Waters , headquartered in Paris , is the world ' s biggest bottled water company. And its division Nestle Waters North America is the largest bottled water producer in the United States , with a total of 29 plants in the U.S. and Canada and net sales of $ 4.1 billion last year. Five of its bottling plants are located in California  in Sacramento , Livermore , Los Angeles , Cabazon and Ontario. A display case in the lobby of the Ontario bottling plant shows early 20th century glass bottles for one of the many brands Nestle has purchased over the years : Arrowhead. The company says water has been sold under an Arrowhead brand since 1894. Nestle has records showing that water has been collected from some of the springs it now uses since at least 1906 , one year before the government in 1907 created the San Bernardino National Forest on lands that had previously been known as a forest reserve. The story of how water bottling developed alongside the hot springs and resort is told in the book "" Arrowhead Springs : California ' s Ideal Resort "" by Mark Landis. According to the book , a sanitarium was first built at the hot springs in 1864 , and by 1909 the Arrowhead Springs Company was formed to start bottling and selling water. For years , water was transported by rail in a "" Water Train "" of tank cars to a bottling plant in Los Angeles. Then , in the 1960s , trucks began hauling water to bottling plants. Nowadays , water from Arrowhead and other springs arrives by tanker truck at the Ontario plant , while water from Deer Canyon Springs flows through a pipeline. Nestle says that nowhere else in the country does its spring water come from sites on national forest lands. The plant also uses purified groundwater to produce the brand Nestle Pure Life. What is ... the process of bottling water in California ? Reporter Ian James and photographer/illustrator Richard Lui explain how spring water is bottled in California , and why there have been growing calls for better tracking of the impacts on water supplies. Edited by Daniel Simon. ( Mar. 24 , 2015 ) Daniel Simon/The Desert Sun Inside the plant , machinery hums. A stream of empty bottles soar past on an air-driven production line. Filled and capped , the bottles emerge on conveyor belts ready to be sold. David Thorpe , Nestle ' s western supply chain director , touted the company ' s water efficiency , saying it takes about 1.3 liters of water to produce one liter of bottled water  much less than soft drinks or beer. "" We ' re very , very efficient water users , "" Thorpe said. "" One of the things we ' re constantly working on is how to become more efficient. "" Statewide , Nestle Waters used a total of 2,164 acre-feet of water from all sources in 2014 , said Larry Lawrence , Nestle ' s natural resource manager. That ' s about 705 million gallons  enough to irrigate roughly 700 acres of farmland , or keep two golf courses green , or fill 1,068 Olympic-size swimming pools. The company ' s water use in the state has been growing along with its sales of bottled water. Figures provided by Nestle show that between 2011 and 2014 , during years of extreme drought , the company ' s water use in California increased 19 percent. Lawrence said , however , that the company carefully monitors its springs and adjusts the volumes of water drawn from different springs in response to the amounts flowing. In Southern California , the company can tap spring water from six locations in Riverside , San Bernardino , San Diego and Inyo counties , and has been drawing water from five of those sites recently. The springs ' names are printed on Arrowhead bottles : Southern Pacific Springs , Long Point Ranch , Palomar Mountain Granite Springs , Deer Canyon Springs , Arrowhead Springs and Coyote Springs. "" Everything is operated sustainably , "" Lawrence said. He said the company has been closely observing all of its springs as the drought has left less water flowing in many areas. "" We watch those flows and we manage our water take to those conditions , "" he said. "" We look at environmental conditions around our sources as well to make sure that there ' s no impacts other than drought impacts that we see naturally occurring. "" There are no regulations that would dictate drought measures for water bottlers and other industries in California. Lawrence said the company has its own internal procedures for managing springs during the dry years. "" We study our springs , and if we ' re seeing a spring slowdown in flow or being impacted in a way that we think is possibly from the drought itself , we may choose to take water from a different source or go to a source that ' s further away from our factory , "" Lawrence said. "" We will restrict the flow from sources based on our assessment of the environment around the spring sites. "" The company ' s water system at Arrowhead Springs is largely "" self-regulating , "" Lawrence said , because it is gravity-fed and there is no pumping involved. He said Nestle uses the spring water that naturally flows from the ground , and the amounts change based on fluctuations in the springs ' flow. And while the company ' s overall water use had increased , Lawrence said Nestle has reduced the use of water from some springs , including Arrowhead , to avoid relying too heavily on them. "" We can harvest what ' s available , "" he said. "" And on really wet years we certainly can ' t take all of the water that ' s available , and on dry years , we ' re pretty careful about what we do take. "" The company says it bottled nearly 25 million gallons from Arrowhead Springs last year , on average about 68,000 gallons a day. That was down from about 27 million gallons during 2013. Those amounts are only a portion of the water drawn from the springs by Nestle. The state water code requires that groundwater pumping data be collected in four Southern California counties , and a group of local water districts gather and verify the information. Records filed with the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District show a total of 51 million gallons of groundwater used in 2013. But Lawrence said a portion of that water is delivered to the old Arrowhead Springs hotel under a contract with the owner , and some of the water is also regularly released back into the canyon , both near the springs and near the hotel. Over the years , the Forest Service has authorized maintenance work such as replacing deteriorated valves and pipes. In a 1993 letter , then-District Ranger Elliott Graham wrote that because the company had kept paying the annual fee and had complied with regulations , "" the permit is deemed valid until a new Special Use Permit is reissued. "" Lawrence said Nestle has sought to renew the expired permit several times and is ready to work with the Forest Service. "" We just have to work through the process , "" Lawrence said. He said Nestle is waiting for word from the Forest Service on the next steps and would welcome "" a science-based study of the watershed. "" "" We ' re hoping just to work through whatever biological process or study of the environment that they want to work with us on , "" Lawrence said. "" We think we can certainly support our conclusions that our business is not harming the environment. "" Sales of bottled water have been booming for years in the United States. Last year , preliminary figures from the Beverage Marketing Corporation showed about $ 13 billion in bottled water sales in 2014 , an increase of 6.1 percent from a year earlier. Bottled water plants are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and in California they are also regulated by the state ' s Department of Public Health. The state ' s list of 108 licensed bottled water plants includes companies that sell individual-size bottles as well as larger jugs for home and office delivery. They range from CG Roxane , which packages Crystal Geyser Alpine Spring Water at plants in Weed and Olancha , to DS Services of America , which bottles brands such as Alhambra to Sparkletts at eight plants across California. One small company , Borrego Springs Bottled Water , sells water pumped from the desert aquifer in San Diego County. Other companies with bottled water plants include Niagara Bottling , Coca-Cola , PepsiCo ' s Bottling Group , and supermarket companies such as Safeway , Vons and Ralphs. To meet growing demand , companies have opened more bottling plants over the years. And some , such as Nestle , have sought out new springs. "" One of the things that we ' re constantly looking for is additional water sources that meet our requirements. They ' re relatively rare , "" Lawrence said. "" The drought year is a great year to go look for water because if it ' s sustaining its volume during a drought , then it ' s a nice , stable source. "" People often contact Nestle offering to sell water from new sources , Lawrence said. The vast majority of those springs don ' t meet the company ' s requirements. But occasionally they do. Since 2005 , Nestle has been bottling water from Deer Canyon Springs in the San Bernardino National Forest under an agreement with the Cucamonga Valley Water District. Nestle approached the water district about the possibility , and the agency wasn ' t using water from the springs at the time. "" We weren ' t pulling from this canyon source because it was yielding such a small amount of water , "" said Kristeen Farlow , a spokeswoman for the Cucamonga Valley Water District. The water district owns rights to use all of the "" subsurface and surface flows "" from the canyon. "" Because it ' s spring water , we sell that water to Nestle at a premium , "" Farlow said. "" We opted to sell them that spring water at a premium so that way we could then take those funds and reinvest. "" That deal , along with gradual rate increases paid by customers , has helped boost the water district ' s operating revenues , which grew from $ 44.7 million in 2005 to $ 83.4 million in 2014. It ' s not clear how much Nestle is paying the water district , or how much the agency has benefitted from the deal. A copy of the agreement that the water district provided to The Desert Sun was heavily redacted to remove references to the price paid and other details. The water district cited an exemption in the state ' s public records law for "" trade secrets. "" The Cucamonga Valley Water District , which supplies water to more than 190,000 customers , says the earnings from Nestle have allowed it to keep customers ' rates lower than they would otherwise be. Just how much isn ' t clear. Lawrence said that Nestle and the water district have built "" a great public-private relationship. "" As part of that relationship , Nestle has provided financial support for the Frontier Project , a state-of-the-art building next to the water district ' s offices that showcases water- and energy-saving construction. Nestle has also sponsored cleanups of creeks. At Deer Canyon Springs , meanwhile , records show the amounts of water flowing to Nestle ' s bottling plant have increased during the drought. The Cucamonga Valley Water District , which sells water under an agreement with Nestle , reported 76 million gallons drawn from Deer Canyon last year , up from 56 million gallons in 2013 and more than in the previous two years. Loe said he ' s troubled that Nestle is removing water that would otherwise flow through the canyon and provide for wildlife. He said it ' s urgent that the Forest Service take a hard look at whether the use of Deer Canyon Springs is taking a toll on the forest. Others have raised concerns about Nestle ' s use of water from a desert spring in Millard Canyon in Cabazon , where the company runs a bottling plant on the reservation of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. Reports filed by the tribe with the state show that 598 acre-feet of groundwater was pumped in Millard Canyon during 2013 , and 3 acre-feet of water was diverted. That translates to 196 million gallons a year , enough water to fill nearly 300 Olympic swimming pools. It ' s not clear how much of that water was bottled. It also isn ' t clear how diverting that water may be affecting the desert spring and the oasis around it. The Morongo tribe has not granted requests by The Desert Sun to visit the area. The tribe and Nestle , however , insist they are managing water sustainably and causing no environmental harm. "" Morongo strictly monitors springs in Millard Canyon as part of its extensive reservation groundwater monitoring program , "" Michael Fisher , a spokesman for the tribe , said in an email. The tribe says it also uses surface water and flows from its wastewater treatment plant to replenish the aquifer. "" Morongo and Nestle continue to carefully monitor and limit the amount of water used by the plant to ensure the springs remain healthy. "" Disputes over bottled water have flared and led to lawsuits in California , Texas , New Hampshire , Maine and Michigan , among other places. In parts of Northern California , some bottling companies have changed their plans in the face of strong local opposition. Nestle Waters proposed in 2003 to build a plant in the town of McCloud , at the base of Mount Shasta. Six years later , after a legal fight over the local government ' s agreement to sell water to Nestle , the company announced it was scrapping the plan and would instead use a plant in Sacramento. In 2009 , Crystal Geyser Water Company announced it would build a bottling plant in the Northern California city of Orland. But facing opposition and a court battle , the company canceled the plan in 2011. Crystal Geyser has since bought a vacant bottling plant previously run by Coca-Cola on the outskirts of the city of Mount Shasta and says it will start bottling sparkling mineral water and other drinks later this year. A group of residents say they ' re deeply worried about the effects on wells and a nearby spring , and are demanding an environment impact report  a step that Siskiyou County officials say isn ' t required in this case. It ' s the sort of argument that has sometimes emerged in fights over bottled water : whether or not agencies are meeting obligations under the California Environmental Quality Act , which requires a review when a project involves significant environmental impacts. California also has other laws intended to protect the flows of streams. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife , for instance , must be notified of any project that would "" substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow. "" However , the state agency doesn ' t have any program to monitor the potential impacts of bottling plants or other businesses on streams. In that regard , the water laws in California and other western states generally provide fewer protections than those of much wetter states in the Great Lakes region , said Noah Hall , a professor who specializes in environmental and water law at Wayne State University in Detroit. In Minnesota , for instance , Hall said state officials respond proactively to relatively dry periods and reduce the amounts of water that permit holders are entitled to use. "" They don ' t wait for the overpumping to harm the stream during the low-flow period , "" Hall said. Not so in California , where Hall said the law is essentially "" about taking the water out of the stream and using it. "" "" The law in most western states regarding water was written more than a hundred years ago when states wanted to see streams dried up to promote economic development , "" Hall said. If people want to see greater protections for streams , he said , "" it ' s time to change the law. "" One significant change came last year as Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that for the first time established a statewide framework for managing groundwater in California. Those measures , which will take years to fully go into effect , give the state new authority to step in when necessary to prevent depleted aquifers from declining further. Primary responsibility for oversight , though , will remain with local agencies. And it ' s often local agencies that , when they are required to , collect data on the quantities of water used by bottling plants. That information isn ' t tracked in a comprehensive way by the state. In some cases , the information is kept confidential. In other cases , it isn ' t collected at all. "" It would be really great if there was public information about how much water these plants actually bottled , and where it came from , "" said Peter Gleick , a water researcher who is president of the Oakland-based Pacific Institute. In order to know whether bottled water is being produced sustainably , he said , people need access to information about the sources tapped and the amounts bottled. "" There ' s so much angst statewide about water in general , and a lot of it is the result of a lack of transparency about who ' s using water to do what , from where , "" Gleick said. "" I ' m a fan of public transparency about water use. The other issue , of course , is there is a question about converting a public good into a private product. "" While researching the bottled water industry several years ago , Gleick requested records from the state and obtained data from license applications showing how much water bottling companies anticipated using. The state Department of Public Health has said recently , however , that it doesn ' t "" authorize , regulate , or track "" the amounts of water used by bottled water plants. The state also doesn ' t keep a breakdown of water use by other sectors , such as golf courses or breweries or factories. Morrie Orang , who manages the water use unit of the Department of Water Resources , said a detailed state breakdown of water use by different industries is on his "" wish list. "" He said the agency plans to create a survey to send to businesses asking them to voluntarily provide information. The way water is managed in California , bottled water plants are subject to the same simple rules as anyone else : As long as a company owns a right to water or buys it from someone who has a right to it , it can keep on pumping. What ' s missing from that system , Gleick said , is oversight and monitoring. "" The real issue is nobody ' s really paying attention to the local consequences on groundwater and streams , "" Gleick said. "" There ' s a real difference between saying , ' We know there ' s no problem because we ' re watching , ' and ' We don ' t know if there ' s a problem because nobody ' s watching. ' Those are different , and all too often with our environmental challenges , we learn that nobody ' s really watching. And that needs to be fixed. "" In the San Bernardino National Forest , the newly announced plan to take up the matter of Nestle ' s expired permit comes as the Forest Service is developing a nationwide policy to manage groundwater on national forests. The agency released a proposed directive for groundwater management in May , saying in a summary that "" there is a clear need for the Forest Service  in cooperation with the States  to take an active role in managing all water resources on these lands. "" The proposal , which is to be finalized later this year , would create new procedures for permits that involve using groundwater. It would also require that the potential impacts of groundwater withdrawals be evaluated , and that the quantities of water drawn from springs be measured and reported to the Forest Service. It ' s not clear how those changes , if adopted , might affect Nestle ' s use of spring water from the national forest. In Strawberry Creek , downstream from Arrowhead Springs , state and federal wildlife officials are considering whether to reintroduce speckled dace to help save waning populations of the fish. According to Nestle , the flows cascading down through the canyon are sustaining a healthy creek. As the Forest Service considers reissuing a permit , the biggest question it will need to answer is whether that is in fact true.

72,"The Antikythera shipwreck is a gift that keeps on giving. First discovered in 1900 by sponge divers and dating to about 65BC , it has been explored multiple times in the decades since , including in 1976 when Jacques-Yves Cousteau and his crew surfaced with almost 300 objects , including human remains. Now a May 22-June 11 return to the shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in the Aegean Sea has yielded 60 new artifacts , including a gold ring , luxury glassware , and a bronze spear that would have been part of a statue. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , which led the effort with the Hellenic Ministry of Culture , also flags one particularly unusual item that may have served to protect the ship from pirates. The lead and iron artifact weighs about 220 pounds and is believed to be what ' s known as a "" dolphin , "" reports the Huffington Post. The idea is that it would be dropped from high up on the mast onto an enemy ship ' s deck. story continues below "" Our new technologies extend capabilities for marine science , "" marine archaeologist Brendan Foley says , technologies that in this instance included using an autonomous robot to detail 2.6 acres of the site in advance of the dive.

The discovery of the bronze arm , plus the metal detector findings , boosts the number of bronze statues suspected to reside at the site. Advertisement What we  re finding is these sculptures are in among and under the boulders ,  explained team member Brendan Foley to The Guardian. We think it means a minimum of seven , and potentially nine , bronze sculptures still waiting for us down there.  Advertisement Bronze statues are exceptionally rare , with only about 50 known to reside from this period. During both the classical and medieval eras , bronze recycling was an important industry  one that resulted in the destruction of countless statues and other artifacts that would , by today  s standards , be priceless. Ironically , some of the finest bronze relics from this era were recovered from shipwrecks. Once these suspected bronze statues are located , a truly herculean effort will be required to pull them out. The archaeologists have several options , including hauling the rocks up or fracturing them into smaller pieces. Regardless , it  ll be a slow , costly , and tedious process. The next expedition is planned for the spring of 2018 , at which time the archaeologists plan to explore the hold of the sunken ship. Advertisement Which , whoa. [ Return to Antikythera Mission , Guardian ]|||||Marine archaeologists have recovered a bronze arm from an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera , where the remains of at least seven more priceless statues from the classical world are believed to lie buried. Divers found the right arm , encrusted and stained green , under half a metre of sediment on the boulder-strewn slope where the ship and its cargo now rest. The huge vessel , perhaps 50m from bow to stern , was sailing from Asia Minor to Rome in 1BC when it foundered near the tiny island between Crete and the Peloponnese. The project team , from the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and Lund University in Sweden , discovered the buried arm with a bespoke underwater metal detector which has revealed the presence of other large metal objects nearby under the seabed. There should be at least seven statues ,  Alexandros Sotiriou , a Greek technical diver on the team told the Guardian. The operation is overseen by Ageliki Simosi , director of the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities , which is responsible for all underwater archaeology in Greece. Detail of the arm discovered under half a metre of sediment by the ancient shipwreck. Photograph : Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO 2017 What we  re finding is these sculptures are in among and under the boulders ,  said Brendan Foley , co-director of the excavations team at Lund University. We think it means a minimum of seven , and potentially nine , bronze sculptures still waiting for us down there.  The boulders that overlie the metal objects weigh several tonnes and may have tumbled onto the wreck during a massive earthquake that shook Antikythera and surrounding islands in the 4th century AD. The bronze arm , probably from a statue of a male , is the highlight of the team  s 2017 excavation season. Among other objects the divers recovered are a patterned slab of red marble the size of a tea tray , a silver tankard , sections of joined wood from the ship  s frame , and a human bone. Last year , the team found the skull , teeth , ribs and other bones of an individual who perished on the wreck. They have since extracted DNA from the skull and from it learned the individual  s sex and where they came from. Until those results are published , the person is known as Pamphilos after divers found the name , meaning friend of all  , carved on a buried cup that had been decorated with an erotic scene.

Archaeologists have since pulled up spectacular bronze and marble statues , ornate glass and pottery , stunning pieces of jewellery , and a remarkable geared device  the Antikythera mechanism  which modelled the motion of the heavens. During the 2017 excavations , divers recovered a bronze disc that may be a missing part of the ancient device. But it is the statues that made the wreck famous. In the 1900s , archaeologists working at the site surfaced pieces of a beautiful Hellenistic bronze , named the Antikythera Youth. The statue now stands in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens alongside an impressive bronze head named the Antikythera philosopher , also hauled from the wreck. Both date to the 4th century BC , raising the question of how they came to be aboard the ill-fated ship 300 years later. Jens Daehner , associate curator of antiquities at the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles , said the Antikythera wreck had already yielded significant bronze statues. The chance to recover another group of lifesize statues associated with the wreck is extraordinary , because bronzes are usually encountered randomly under the sea , picked up by fishing nets or chanced upon by divers ,  he said. Those finds are not excavated like at Antikythera , where archaeologists can and do document the entire context , which provides all the sorts of very valuable data as to when the sculptures were transported and why they were on the ship : for trade , as booty , or as scrap metal to be recycled.  As well as the arm , divers have recovered a patterned slab of red marble the size of a tea tray , a silver tankard , sections of joined wood from the ship  s frame and a human bone. Photograph : Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO 2017 Photograph : Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO 2017 The bronze recycling industry was huge in classical times and later in the medieval period , leading to the destruction of countless statues and other artefacts that would be priceless today. For this reason , many of the finest specimens of bronze statues that survive were once lost at sea. Ancient bronze sculpture in general is rare due to the metal having been recycled in antiquity and later. We think of the ones from the sea as those that got away ,  said Daehner. Any chance to recover more Greek sculptures in any medium , but particularly in bronze , should not be missed.  To recover the statues will take a massive effort. The divers must first remove boulders that are in their way , either by hauling them up , or by drilling holes in the rocks and filling them with grout that expands to fracture the stone. Another option is to crack the boulders open with small shaped charges that technical divers use to rescue people trapped when undersea caves collapse. But even if the statues can be lifted from the sea , they will be broken and need costly and time-consuming conservation and reconstruction. Statues are not the only objects the excavators hope to find. The latest excavations uncovered a lump of material bearing a bronze disc that matches the size of geared wheels found in the Antikythera mechanism. Wound by a handle , the device showed the movement of the sun , moon and planets in the sky , but not all of the machine was recovered. The disc looks very exciting indeed ,  said Andrew Ramsey , a CT specialist at Nikon Metrology in Tring , who used CT scans to read inscriptions on the original pieces of the mechanism. But the disc may be something entirely different. Preliminary x-ray images reveal no teeth , but an image of a bull , suggesting the disc is not a cog but a decorative item. Divers also discovered this piece of material bearing a bronze disc that matches the size of geared wheels found in the Antikythera mechanism. Photograph : Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO 2017 Mike Edmunds , emeritus professor of astrophysics at Cardiff University and a member of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project , said the findings are impressive. They are getting very good at detecting bronze items which raises the possibility that they may be able to find either the missing planetary gearing from the Antikythera mechanism , which we know is there from the analysis of the inscriptions on the mechanism , or a new piece of mechanism , or another mechanism that was being transported , and that would be very exciting.  The team will return to the wreck in the spring , optimistic that they may pull up fresh treasures from the wreck. It  s not going to be just the bronze sculptures ,  said Foley. We  re down in the hold of the ship now , so all the other things that would have been carried should be down there as well. Every day is going to be like opening Tut  s tomb . "
73,"Hikers in San Francisco know them well : miles of stacked stones spanning portions of the rugged hills overlooking the East Bay. The crude walls have been compared to Easter Island and Stonehenge because like those two ancient sites , their origins are shrouded in mystery. No historical documents exist to shed light on who built them , or when , and as a naturalist told The Monthly in 2014 , "" The mystery walls never attracted serious scholarship , so all we have is in the realm of people spinning ideas. "" Now , local archaeologist Jeffrey Fentress is measuring and mapping them so as to gain them entry into the state archive , which would lend protection from things like development. In light of Fentress ' effort , the Mercury News takes a look at what we know , or think we know , about the walls. story continues below At the turn of the 20th century , scholars speculated the 3- to 4-foot-tall mortar-free walls , which do not run continuously , were built by ancient civilizations , or by the Mongolians. A recent testing of lichen growing on the rocks suggests otherwise. While not a perfect dating technique , it places them in the 1850-1880 period. Modern experts ' best guess is they contained the cattle of post-Gold Rush European immigrants , though there ' s no consensus on which country those immigrants hailed from  or whom they may have tasked with building them ( Mexicans ? The Chinese ? Native Americans ? ) But those unknown builders are forever captured in the walls , says Fentress : "" They are essentially the archaeology of the working class , the common people who came here and made a living.

Now two other adjectives also define this luxury high-rise : sinking and tilting. Residents paid millions of dollars to live in the roughly 400-unit skyscraper. The building boasts an indoor pool , fitness center , wine cellar and private dining room. The tower has attracted Bay Area elites like NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana ; San Francisco Giants outfielder Hunter Pence ; Tibco founder and Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive ; and the late legendary venture capitalist Tom Perkins , who paid more than $ 9 million for the penthouse. The tony tower is now attracting attention from a different group of powerful San Franciscans , however : the city ' s politicians , who want to understand why this 58-story building has sunk 16 inches , and is tilting at least 2 inches to the northwest since it was completed eight years ago. Thursday , San Francisco city Supervisor Aaron Peskin will hold a hearing on the tower. "" We are in the midst of a huge building boom , "" Peskin tells CNBC. "" We should make sure that we are building to the highest standards , and that we are building the safest buildings that we can in San Francisco , which is a seismically challenged part of the world . ""|||||SAN FRANCISCO ( CBS SF )  The developers of a towering skyscraper that is sinking in San Francisco  s South of Market neighborhood were served with a subpoena Tuesday as city officials investigate whether owners of the building  s luxury apartments were told about the structural issues as required by state law. In a letter accompanying the subpoena , San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera wrote : I have serious concerns that the disclosures required by state law pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1102 et seq. did not contain information about the settling of the Property , and as such , did not accurately inform purchasers of the more than 400 units of the conditions at the Property.  ALSO READ : The 58-story luxury high-rise at 301 Mission St. , which was completed in 2009 , has sunk as much as 16 inches and is leaning around 15 inches to the northwest at its peak. Current projections suggest it could ultimately sink more than 30 inches. Meanwhile , the developers of the high rise , Millennium Partners , on Tuesday blamed the building  s excessive settlement on groundwater pumping at the neighboring Transbay Terminal construction site. Speaking at a press conference in downtown San Francisco , founding partner Christopher Jeffries said what he called reckless behavior  on the part of the Transbay Joint Powers Authority has caused the Millennium Tower to sink more than was originally projected. Jeffries said that groundwater pumping started at the Transbay Terminal project a full year earlier than officials have previously stated and has caused groundwater in the area to drop a staggering  20 feet. The authority agreed before construction started to strictly limit and monitor any effects on groundwater in the area around the Transbay Terminal site. However , when it became clear those limits had been exceeded it refused to act and instead blamed issues on the design of the Millennium Tower and stopped responding to requests for data , Jeffries said. There  s been a lot of talk and speculation about what people think the problem is ,  Jeffries said. There is only one issue here. TJPA  s dewatering is the issue.  Transbay Joint Powers Authority officials did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday , but have previously blamed the Millennium Tower  s settlement issues on the fact that it was designed with a concrete slab foundation and piles into sand rather than bedrock. A lawsuit filed in August by lawyers representing homeowners alleges that the decision to not drill down to bedrock was in order to cut costs.  The lawsuit also names the Transbay Joint Powers Authority , and alleges that excavation on the Transbay Terminal project next door has contributed to the Millennium Tower  s subsidence. The authority has argued that the building , which was completed in 2009 , had already settled more than anticipated by 2010 , before construction began on the Transbay Terminal site , and that other buildings in the area have not shown similar issues. Millennium Partners officials on Tuesday argued that the building  s foundation is of the same design used by most current buildings of its size in the city , and that drilling down into bedrock is not normal practice. While they acknowledged that the building had sunk more than projected by 2010 , they said the amount was well within design limits. San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin said documents show that city officials were raising concerns about the structure as far back as 2006 , and asking questions about the settlement of the building in 2009 just months before signing off on the final certificate of occupancy that allowed Millennium Partners to begin selling units. He said there were troubling gaps in the record , however , that left it unclear how the developer had responded. It is incontrovertible that the Millennium Corporation knew before they sold their first unit that the building was sinking more than they projected ,  Peskin said. I have contacted individuals who own units , they were not informed of the fact that the Millennium Corporation knew and should have discussed that the building was sinking.  Peskin said he believed there was some level of political interference  in the decision making process of the Department of Building Inspection , but did not specify who might be responsible. P.J. Johnston , a spokesman for Millennium Partners , has maintained that the building remains safe and that its settlement had remained within projected limits until the Transbay Terminal project began construction in 2010. He rejected the suggestion that political influence played any role in the building  s approval. The company is working with the homeowners to make any necessary fixes , Johnston said.

74,"On Tuesday , Hurricane Irma  currently the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded outside the Caribbean Sea or Gulf of Mexico  hit wind speeds of 185mph , the Baltimore Sun reports. And scientists are split on whether it ' s even possible for a hurricane to get much stronger. According to Live Science , warm water makes hurricanes stronger , and warming oceans due to climate change could theoretically create ever-stronger hurricanes. For example , NOAA states human-caused global warming could increase hurricane strength by 2 % to 11 % by the end of the 21st century. And some scientists say wind speeds will increase by about 5 % for every degree Celsius increase in ocean temperature. Others disagree ; a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center says hurricane winds are unlikely ever to top 200mph. In 1998 , scientists calculated maximum hurricane wind speeds of 190mph based on current environmental conditions. story continues below But regardless of how strong their winds can or will get , no hurricane will ever be stronger than a Category 5. That ' s because the Saffir-Simpson scale has no Category 6. A Category 5 hurricane is one that has wind speeds of 156mph or more. Robert Simpson says he didn ' t go higher than Category 5 when creating the scale because at that point potential damage is all the same. At 5 ... you already have catastrophic damage ,  Dennis Feltgen at the National Hurricane Center tells WDBO. It  s done.

But this monster storm is even shaking the earth itself. Aidan Kelley has the story. Buzz60 Hurricane Irma is so strong it ' s showing up on seismometers  equipment designed to measure earthquakes. "" What we  re seeing in the seismogram are low-pitched hums that gradually become stronger as the hurricane gets closer to the seismometer on the island of Guadeloupe , "" said Stephen Hicks , a seismologist at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom. The noise is likely caused by high winds  which cause tiny motions in the ground  and also by trees swaying in the wind , which also transfers energy into the ground , he said. The seismometer is located close to the ocean , so waves crashing along the coastline reverberate around the island , also generating seismic energy , Hicks added.

Firefighters braved the brutal cold overnight and into Saturday to battle the blaze , which engulfed an entire city block and veiled the city  s skyline with smoke. The fire started before midnight , and there were at least two explosions at the site , Passaic Mayor Hector Lora said. The cause was not immediately known. About 70 people were working Friday night and all were safely evacuated , the mayor said. One firefighter was taken to the hospital but has been released and is "" doing well. "" Other firefighters were treated at the scene for exhaustion and a few slip and falls due to the icy conditions.

"" The safety of everyone is paramount so we don  t want to rush too much , "" said Lora. Passaic Fire Chief Patrick Trentacost and Construction Official Nagy Sileem made the call to demolish the building. The mayor said Chris Riviello , the company ' s owner , said he would try to relocate the plant ' s 200 employees , many of whom live nearby. "" It  s been a difficult year where there  s so many challenges with paying bills , food and security , utilities and rent , "" said Lora.

It has four locations  the others are in Lakewood , Tinton Falls and Neptune , its website states. The fire ' s billowing smoke could be seen for miles. Nearby residents were told to keep their windows shut Saturday morning because of a strong smell of burning plastic. But the fire did not spread beyond the plant ' s five acres and no evacuation orders were given for the surrounding neighborhood. The firefighters were perched on ladders high above the recycling plant as they worked , and , with temperatures plunging below 20 degrees , the streets iced over from the water pouring out of their hoses. "" I walked outside and it was punch-you-in-the-face cold , "" Lora said. Firefighters from more than 25 departments in four counties responded. First responders had been prepared to pump water from the Passaic River , but found it wasn  t a viable option , said Lora. The view of the fire was evocative of the Marcal blaze in nearby Elmwood Park , which , coincidentally , happened two years ago to the day of the Passaic blaze. That 10-alarm fire leveled much of the paper plant and toppled the iconic Marcal sign over Route 80. The cause has never been determined. Investigators with the Bergen County Prosecutor ' s Office conducted more than 100 interviews and concluded that the fire started in the most northeastern building on the southern side of the railroad tracks. It began in a storage area that held large rolls of paper. Lora said the similarities to the Marcal fire , including the similar date , temperatures and conditions was "" a lot to take in.

77,"A British diver who helped save a junior football team from a cave in Thailand has himself been rescued from a flooded tunnel in the US after more than a day underground. Josh Bratchley failed to return to the surface with the rest of a party after they emerged from a cave in Jackson County , Tennessee , at around 3pm on Tuesday. After several attempts to find him themselves , his fellow divers alerted emergency services at around 1am local time ( 7am BST ) on Wednesday morning. Expert divers were flown in from Arkansas and Florida and a rescue dive began at around 6pm on Wednesday evening. Authorities said he was successfully rescued around an hour later. He was awake , alert and oriented ,  rescue official Derek Woolbright told a press conference. His only request when he got to the surface was that he wanted some pizza.  Bratchley was evaluated by medical crews on scene and found to be stable. He refused medical treatment and transport. The diver was praised for his composure by lieutenant Brian Krebs , from Chattanooga Hamilton County Rescue Services. He really did this for himself. Most of what happened here today was Josh , his mental state is excellent , he  s in good health , he  s fine.  Rescue diver Edd Sorenson added : I could  ve got to him sooner , but I was looking at every nook and cranny looking for a body. There were broken lines and it was a very silty , dangerous low cave. We came up to the air pocket and shockingly there he was , calm as could be. He just said thank you , thank you. Who are you ?   Bratchley was part of a crack team of British cave diving experts who helped save 12 schoolboys and their football coach from a flooded cave in Thailand last year. A meteorologist by trade , he was later honoured at a reception held by the prime minister at Downing Street and appointed MBE in the 2019 New Year  s Honours list. Bill Whitehouse , vice-chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council , said Bratchley entered Mill Pond Cave on Tuesday to replace a guideline .|||||A British cave diver who was part of the dramatic rescue of a Thai youth soccer team last year was himself rescued from a pitch-black underwater cave in northern Tennessee on Wednesday night , authorities said. Josh Bratchley was retrieved from the Mill Pond Cave system near Gainesboro in Jackson County , about 65 miles northeast of Nashville , by Edd Sorenson , a veteran technical cave diver from Marianna , Florida , who is internationally known for many high-profile cave rescues. Bratchley  who was made a member of the Order of the British Empire in December for his role in the Thai rescue last summer  was in good shape and refused medical treatment , the Jackson County Sheriff ' s Office said. While Bratchley and his colleagues were conducting the rescue in Thailand last year , Sorenson walked NBC News through the obstacles they would have been facing. On Wednesday , Sorenson was able to rescue Bratchley. Sorenson said at a news conference Wednesday night that he went into the cave system expecting the worst because of the cold underwater temperatures and the complete lack of visibility. "" Most of the time on rescues , when I get there , they ' re hysterical , they ' re panicked , and that makes it very dangerous for me , "" Sorenson said. But he called Bratchley "" a consummate professional. "" "" Putting people in body bags all the time is no fun , and when you get to send one home , it ' s an exceptional feeling , "" he said. Ethan Burris , a spokesman for the Jackson County Emergency Management Agency , said Bratchley was with a small team of British divers who have been exploring the cave system for two or three days. The group called 911 shortly after midnight Tuesday when members noticed that Bratchley was unaccounted for after their last dive Tuesday afternoon , he said. Burris said the group ' s members waited to call 911 because they were unsuccessfully searching for their colleague themselves. Lt. Brian Krebs , a cave rescue specialist for the Chattanooga Hamilton County Rescue Service  members of which were flown in by the state Highway Patrol to help in the rescue  agreed that Bratchley was largely responsible for saving his own life , saying that because he ' d been in the cave the day before , he knew where crucial air pockets were. "" Luckily , Josh was found right where we ' d thought he ' d be , "" Krebs said. Because of Bratchley ' s expertise , Krebs said , what had been feared to be a recovery mission of as long as two hours turned out to be a safe rescue that took only 45 minutes. "" He did not panic. Most of everything he did today was in his head , and he controlled that very , very well , "" Krebs said. Derek Woolbright , a spokesman for the Jackson County Emergency Management Agency , said Bratchley had only one request when he emerged from the water Wednesday night : "" He wanted some pizza . """

79,"Fight disinformation. Get a daily recap of the facts that matter. Sign up for the free Mother Jones newsletter Update , May 8 , 2015 : In a statement on Thursday , Starbucks announced it would be moving its California bottling operations to Pennsylvania over the next six months , citing concerns over the drought crisis. We are committed to our mission to be a globally responsible company and to support the people of the state of California as they face this unprecedented drought ,  John Kelly , the company  s senior vice president of Global Responsibility and Public Policy said. Ethos Water was supposed to help fix the global water crisis : Founded in 2002 in Southern California , the bottled-water company promised that for every unit it sold , it would donate a small amount of money to water charity projects in the developing world. The idea quickly took off. In 2005 , Ethos was acquired by Starbucks. Now , for every $ 1.95 bottle of Ethos water it sells , Starbucks makes a 5-cent donation to the Ethos Water Fund , part of the Starbucks Foundation. When our customers choose to buy Ethos Water , they  re improving the lives of people who lack vital resources ,  Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in 2008. Some of the biggest celebrities in Hollywood have lent their names to Starbucks  Ethos brand. Matt Damon starred in an ad campaign , and Starbucks partnered with a company that drives celebrities to the Oscars and filled the cars with Ethos bottles , so Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz walked into the awards carrying Ethos Water ,  as Ethos cofounder Peter Thum explained. In 2011 , Ethos  other cofounder , Jonathan Greenblatt , became special assistant to the president and head of the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation. Obama himself lauded Greenblatt last fall for his innovative solutions to America  s challenges.  Starbucks says that its partnership with Ethos has raised more than $ 12.3 million for water charity projects to date. So far , media coverage has focused on Starbucks  goal to quench the thirst of the world  s parched masses ; the story behind the bottled water it sells here in the United States has been a nonissue. But now , as California  s historic drought wears on , Starbucks is facing a water crisis of its own. Starbucks gets its spring water free of charge  in California , water companies typically don  t have to pay for the groundwater they use. The bottling plant that Starbucks uses for its Ethos customers in the western United States is located in Merced , California , which is currently ranked in the exceptional drought  category by the US Drought Monitor. Its residents face steep water cuts in their homes , and surface water for the region  s many farms is drying up. On April 16 , the Merced Sun-Star reported that residents were complaining about a private water bottler , owned and operated by the grocery chain Safeway , that ships the increasingly scarce groundwater out for profit. In addition to its own bottled water , the plant also produces Starbucks  Ethos water. No one knows exactly how much water the plant is using  the city of Merced considers that information confidential. ( Starbucks uses a water source in Pennsylvania for the Ethos bottles sold in its locations in the eastern United States. ) The Starbucks water bottled at the plant comes from private springs in Baxter , a small unincorporated community in Placer County , a few hours north of Merced in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The spring water comes free of charge  in California , water companies typically don  t have to pay for the groundwater they use. Like Merced , Baxter is located in exceptional drought  territory. In a story about the water shortage last year , the New York Times pointed to a community near Baxter , quoting a rancher as saying that the drought was as bad as I have ever experienced.  When I asked a Starbucks spokesman about the company  s reaction to concerns about bottlers  use of increasingly scarce water , he told me that Starbucks uses a private spring source that is not used for municipal water for any communities.  But Mary Scruggs , a supervising engineering geologist with California  s Department of Water Resources , notes that communities can be affected by the use of surrounding springs if you capture and pull it out before it ever makes it  to downstream users. The bottling plant that Starbucks uses is located in Merced , California , which is currently ranked in the exceptional drought  category. Bottling companies are trusted to monitor the health of their springs and the recharge rate , though in California the regulation and monitoring of bottled water extraction and its environmental impacts is notoriously opaque. Unlike in other states , well logs are kept confidential and reviewing such data requires permission from the well owner. In addition to the spring water it bottles , Starbucks also uses Merced city water to manufacture its bottled water product. A report commissioned by the International Bottled Water Association found that it takes on average 1.32 liters of water to make a liter of bottled water , though critics argue that it can take several times more than that once all the packaging is accounted for. In March , Merced County passed an ordinance that will place new permitting restrictions on some groundwater use , though whether this will affect the Starbucks bottling plant remains to be seen. We  re cautious about setting precedents ,  says Ron Rowe , director of the Division of Environmental Health for Merced County , adding that his agency hasn  t yet issued permits for any company under the new ordinance. Starbucks declined to provide sales figures for Ethos Water , but the company  s estimate of $ 12.3 million given to charity works out to about 246 million bottles sold. Given the original price of $ 1.80 a bottle , by my calculation , that  s more than $ 442 million in sales. While bottled water accounts for just a small fraction of California  s total water use , some residents are nonetheless fed up with bottling plants that profit off their dwindling water supply. Protesters have begun staging events at Nestl  s bottling facility in nearby Sacramento. Starbucks , with its mission to bring water to the world  s thirstiest regions , has so far escaped the kind of scrutiny that Nestl and others have endured. But as a Merced area resident recently noted during a city council meeting about the bottling plant that Starbucks uses , You might think that in the midst of a drought emergency , diverting public fresh water supplies to bottle and selling them would be frowned upon.  This article was reported in partnership with the Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute , with support from the Puffin Foundation .|||||The water shortage in California has people cutting down on shower times and keeping usage to a minimum  which has led activists to rail against Nestle Waters , accused of profiting off its water-bottling operations at the expense of the environment , Newsweek reports. Backing up these claims is an investigation by the Desert Sun that unearthed a lack of oversight on Nestle ' s practices , including the revelation that there ' s been little to no assessment on how bottling water in the state affects water supplies and ecosystems. Also : Nestle ' s permit to suck up this water expired in 1988. The US Forest Service says it will do an "" environmental analysis , "" but "" only this year , after a group of critics raised concerns in letters and after the Desert Sun inquired about the expired permit , "" notes the newspaper. story continues below Of the 108 water-bottling plants in California , five are operated by Nestle , the leading bottled-water supplier worldwide. No state agency monitors how much water is extracted by these plants , notes the Sun. Nestle released a statement that said its 2014 water usage in California was 705 million gallons  which it calls a relatively modest amount , about what it would take to irrigate two golf courses. But critics tell the paper that in the mid-2000s the Forest Service scrutinized permits for forest cabin owners , not saying boo about Nestle. "" We made the little people do the right thing , and we ' re not making the big people do the right thing , "" a retired biologist with the service tells the paper.

Starbucks said Thursday it will move its Ethos bottled water production to Pennsylvania over the next six months. It is trying to find a new water source for the West Coast , the company said. "" We are committed to our mission to be a globally responsible company and to support the people of the state of California as they face this unprecedented drought , "" John Kelly , Starbucks senior vice president of Global Responsibility and Public Policy , said in a statement. Stores in California will also reduce water use by more than 25 percent , the coffee chain said. The company said it made the decision in order to help California conserve water. Last week , Mother Jones pointed out that Starbucks ' Ethos water sold in the Western United States draws its supply from private springs in Baxter , California , which is classified by the state as being in "" exceptional drought. "" Starbucks donates 5 cents for every bottle of Ethos water it sells to the Ethos Water Fund , which makes grants to improve water and sanitation projects in countries that face water challenges , the company said on its website. Starbucks said it has distributed over $ 12 million since buying the water company in 2005. California  s water board this week approved a mandatory 25 percent urban water reduction called for by Gov. Jerry Brown , as well as other regulations designed to save water. California is in its fourth year of drought. IN-DEPTH  Phil Helsel"

Now , anger over the story has fueled $ 33,000 in donations to first responder Lauren Kwei  and questions about why the story was published in the first place. The article , headlined NYC medic helped make ends meet  with racy OnlyFans side gig ,  attempted to make something scandalous out of the fact that the 23-year-old had posted nude photos to the popular subscription site. It cited a subscriber who counted 32 posts by Kwei , and quoted an anonymous FDNY paramedic turned morality cop who snarked that other first responders make more money by pulling extra shifts , instead of pulling off their clothes.  In the article , Kwei defended herself by telling the Post , What I do in my free time is my business. It has no effect on how I care for my patients. I know when I  m working , I  m a paramedic. I think I  m pretty good at my job.  Apparently , many others agreed. The article was quickly decried by critics on Twitter , including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez ( D-NY ) , who tweeted at the publication , Leave her alone. The actual scandalous headline here is Medics in the United States need two jobs to survive.   The tweet received over 300,000 more likes than the Post  s tweet of its story. This weekend , one of Kwei  s friends started a GoFundMe page in her name , writing that Kwei had turned to sex work in order to support herself and her family and was now at risk of losing her job. Kwei herself said as much to the Post , telling the reporter she had taken down her OnlyFans in the hopes that I won  t lose my job in the middle of a pandemic and three weeks before Christmas.  ( A representative for SeniorCare EMS told The Daily Beast that Kwei is still employed and it does not intend to let her go over this issue. ) We are asking for donations to help Lauren keep her freedoms of choice and expression to support herself during her legal battles against the newspaper and her fight to keep the job she loves ,  her friend wrote on the GoFundMe. In a little over a day , the page attracted more than 1,500 donors and raised $ 33,000  far above the stated goal of $ 5,000. Stay strong !  one donor commented. The shame belongs to those who tried to shame you. You weren  t hurting anyone , you were merely attempting to make a living because your job as a front-line healthcare worker , helping to save people  s lives , doesn  t pay enough  which is the real shame.  Another wrote simply , Because no-one should live in fear of some fragile toad of a man ruining your life for a non-story.  In a post for the GoFundMe , Kwei chimed in to say she is currently in West Virginia taking care of her father  the sole provider for the family  who had gone into cardiac arrest last week. She said she had started the OnlyFans because she did not want to ask her parents for money and could not reasonably work more than 40 hours a week , but couldn  t afford to live on a paramedic  s salary. ( Even a paramedic quoted by the Post admitted that the pay at such jobs was pretty crappy.  ) She added she had not spoken with her employer yet and was not sure what they would do , but that she would continue to fight for my name and reputation.  I truly believe I do not HAVE to explain myself , but I want to ,  she wrote. I know in my heart that I did nothing wrong , but it really helps to be reminded that I do not deserve to be treated like this or spoken about this way.  I don ' t think I deserve all the kindness you all have shown to me , but I cannot thank you all enough ,  she added. I ' m a strong woman because I have strong women all around me. I did nothing wrong and I will not take this lying down . |||||The New York Post reached a new low on Friday when the outlet ran a story exposing a New York City paramedic as a part-time sex worker.

The Post details where she  s from , why she came to New York , where she went to school , what she studied. It goes on to luridly discuss her sex work , detailing her height and weight , describing some of the photos and videos she sells , and publishing the handle to her page. The Post also includes a quote from a veteran FDNY paramedic  who criticizes her for her part-time work , voicing what seems to me to be the explicit opinion of the piece : Other EMTs and paramedics make more money by pulling extra shifts , instead of pulling off their clothes ,  he said. If there  s anything to take away from the story it  s that paramedics don  t get paid enough , and that she shouldn  t have to have a second job just to scrape by. But it should not have been reported to begin with , most of all because she says the authors of the piece didn  t respect her requests for anonymity , and now she  s at risk of losing her job. On a GoFundMe page set up by an acquaintance from a Facebook group , she said she begged  the reporter to whom she spoke to remain anonymous , and made it clear to him that he would be jeopardizing her job if he published her full name.

She also posted images on her OnlyFans account , where subscribers can see her in lingerie  or in the buff  for fees starting at $ 11.99 a month. The bottom line : I don  t get paid a lot.

Kwei defended her side gig. At the end of the day , it doesn  t affect how I treat people. What I do in my free time is my business. It has no effect on how I care for my patients. I know when I  m working , I  m a paramedic. I think I  m pretty good at my job.  Kwei added , There are plenty of people who are medical professionals who have every right to do what they want with their own bodies. I  m not doing it at work. Health care workers aren  t making a lot of money. And I  m not the only one trying to make ends meet.  Kwei moved to New York in 2015 to pursue the performing arts ,  and graduated in May 2017 from The American Musical and Dramatic Academy , a private conservatory on the Upper West Side whose alumni include singer Jason Derulo and actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson. She said she studied musical theater. Lauren Caitlyn Kwei shown promoting her OnlyFans account on social media Kwei , who lives in the Bronx , started auditioning , she said , but soon realized she didn  t like showbiz  and wasn  t giving back to my community.  Kwei started EMT school in September 2017 and graduated the following February. In March 2018 , Kwei started working for SeniorCare EMS as an EMT making minimum wage  about $ 15 an hour , she said. After a year on the job , she stopped working temporarily to complete paramedic training at the Center for Allied Health Education , which charges $ 13,200 in tuition. As a paramedic , Kwei earns $ 25 an hour , she told The Post. Private ambulance companies generally pay much less than big hospitals , or the FDNY  s Emergency Medical Service , where paramedics start at $ 48,237 annually and make $ 65,226 in base salary before overtime after five years. The pay is pretty crappy ,  another paramedic said of rookie jobs with private ambulance companies. It  s where you go to get experience.  Kwei also worked as a hostess at an upscale Korean steakhouse to help pay her bills. Kwei was not secretive about her online exploits. She made her last name known in her Instagram timeline , and her Twitter handle , @FoxxyLlama , said NYC paramedic  along with a solicitation for Only Fans.  After Kwei first spoke to The Post , she deleted at least seven OnlyFans posts , including an offer to watch a 16 sec shower  video for $ 10.

"" ( Read more earthquake stories. )|||||Powerful earthquakes like the 6.2-magnitude temblor that rocked central Italy early this morning ( Aug. 24 ) are surprisingly common in the region , geologists say. The shaking was caused by movement in the Tyrrhenian Basin , a seismically active area beneath the Mediterranean Sea. Here , the ground is actually spreading apart , said Julie Dutton , a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. The same underlying geology was responsible for the devastating 2009 earthquake in the city of L ' Aquila , just 34 miles ( 55 kilometers ) away from today  s quake. That earthquake killed more than 300 people. "" It ' s a pretty complicated or complex area for earthquakes , "" Dutton told Live Science. "" In this area , they have sizable earthquakes that cause destruction every so many years. "" [ Photos of This Millennium ' s Most Destructive Earthquakes ] Complex damaging geology The epicenter of today ' s quake , which hit around 3 : 30 a.m. local time , was about 6.2 miles ( 10 km ) southeast of the historic tourist town of Norcia. The earthquake killed at least 73 people and turned scores of charming medieval buildings into rubble. The shaking was felt all the way in Rome , about 70 miles ( 112 km ) southwest of the city. The temblor was caused by complicated geology. In northeastern Italy , the slow-motion collision of the African and Eurasian plates has pushed up the ground beneath the Alps. In fact , many of the quakes have occurred in towns fringing the Appenine Mountains , along the northeastern coast of Italy. However , the quakes themselves are not caused directly by this uplift process. Instead , because the continental plate collision zone is drifting southeast , it is stretching the crust beneath a region of the Mediterranean Sea. This ground extension , which occurs at a 90-degree angle relative to the mountain range , is what was behind both the current earthquake and the 2009 L ' Aquila temblor , Dutton said. "" It ' s a normal fault earthquake and it ' s an expression of the east-west extensional tectonics where the Tyrrhenian Basin is being opened up , "" Dutton said. Normal faults occur when the ground on one side of the fault slides down relative to the other side , and the motion goes in the direction expected based on the pull of gravity on the Earth , according to the U.S. Geological Survey. This region is no stranger to ground shaking. In 2009 , the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck L ' Aquila led to a trial in which the seismologists in the area were convicted of manslaughter for failing to predict the quake. ( The guilty verdict against the scientists was later overturned. ) In 1997 , a 6.0-magnitude earthquake killed more than 100 people and damaged 80,000 homes. And records going back nearly 700 years document terrifying earthquakes in central Italy that caused people to abandon towns during the Middle Ages. Original article on Live Science ."
82,"PORT-AU-PRINCE ( Reuters ) - Government officials and aid partners in earthquake- and cholera-ravaged Haiti scrambled on Monday to prepare crowded quake survivor camps and coastal towns for a possible hit by a hurricane later this week. A woman sells food under rain at down town Port-au-Prince October 31 , 2010. REUTERS/ Eduardo Munoz Tropical Storm Tomas , which is heading westward across the eastern Caribbean sea , is expected to turn north toward Haiti and Dominican Republic by the end of the week , and restrengthen as a hurricane , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Jamaica also could be impacted , although the precise track of the storm remained uncertain , the forecasters said. Tomas now threatens another humanitarian emergency for disaster-prone Haiti , the Western Hemisphere  s poorest state. Haiti suffered a devastating earthquake in January and is grappling with a cholera epidemic that has killed at least 330 people so far and sickened nearly 5,000 more. This storm is approaching at a time when aid agencies in Haiti are already stretched to the limit ,  said Nigel Fisher , the humanitarian coordinator for the United Nations in Haiti. The humanitarian challenges involved are among the most complex I  ve seen in my entire career ,  Fisher added in a statement. As a Category 1 hurricane over the weekend , Tomas battered Barbados , St. Lucia and St. Vincent in the Windward Islands , ripping roofs off homes and knocking down trees and power lines. Insurance experts were estimating damage-linked insurance payouts for the three islands would top $ 10 million. In St. Lucia , the west coast tourist town of Soufriere , the area hardest hit by Tomas as it passed , was cut off by landslides blocking roads and accessible only by sea , the National Emergency Management Organization ( NEMO ) said. A NEMO spokesperson told Reuters emergency services were checking unconfirmed reports that at least five people , and possibly more , were killed in the Soufriere landslides. At 5 p.m. on Monday , Tomas was carrying top sustained winds of 45 miles per hour , and was located about 65 miles northeast of Aruba , moving westwards , the Miami-based hurricane center said. Haiti or Jamaica are the most likely targets of Tomas ,  hurricane expert Jeff Masters of private U.S. forecaster Weather Underground wrote in his blog , citing computer forecast models. But he added weather conditions meant the exact track of Tomas remained uncertain , and the storm could still be in the Caribbean a week from now. CAMPS SEEN VULNERABLE TO WIND , RAIN Haitian officials and aid workers are worried that the powerful winds and torrential rain associated with Tomas will menace more than 1.3 million homeless earthquake survivors living in tent and tarpaulin camps scattered across the hilly capital Port-au-Prince. In September , a powerful storm in the capital killed at least six people , injured 70 and destroyed or damaged the tent or tarpaulin homes of more than 10,000 families. Floods and mudslides in mid-October killed 10 more people. U.N. agencies and aid groups are rushing emergency supplies of medicine , food and shelter materials to the camps and to the coastal towns of Les Cayes and Gonaives , which could be hit by storm surges and flooding. We need emergency shelter. We need water and sanitation supplies. And we need as much of it as possible in place before Hurricane Tomas hits ,  Fisher said. With a full-scale evacuation of camps and threatened coastal communities deemed impossible , authorities urged those who could do so to seek more secure refuge in the homes of friends and family. The United Nations said Haiti  s government had agreed to the United States sending the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima to support logistics operations , which the 12,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force in the country will also be assisting. The magnitude 7 earthquake that hit Haiti  s capital on January 12 killed up to 300,000 people and left 1.3 million homeless .|||||Haiti is at serious risk of further devastation from earthquakes in the near future , geologists have warned. Their research , to be published in next month ' s issue of Nature Geoscience , indicates that not all the geological strain that triggered the original quake in January has been released as had been thought. More than 230,000 people died in the magnitude 7.0 quake on 12 January and more than one million were left homeless. Now geologists are warning that Haiti faces the prospect of further devastation. "" The January earthquake only unloaded a fraction of the seismic energy that has built up over time in Haiti , "" Eric Calais , a geologist at Purdue University , Indiana , who is also a science adviser for the UN development programme in Haiti , told Nature. "" Other earthquakes are therefore inevitable. "" The Haiti quake  which struck at 4.53pm local time and lasted 30 seconds  occurred at the interface of the Caribbean and North American tectonic plates , which are slowly sliding past each other. Seismic strain builds up at certain points where the plates touch and this is abruptly released when they jump position. Port-au-Prince , the capital of Haiti , has twice been destroyed , in 1751 and 1770. For the past 10 months , geologists have been investigating a geological fault system on the boundary of the two plates known as the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden. This was thought to be the centre of the quake. However , to their surprise no evidence to support this assumption has been found. "" This is pretty bizarre , "" said Roger Bilham , a geologist at the University of Colorado. One explanation , he suggests , is that the surface part of the fault was clamped shut by a complex series of ground slips. "" If so , another strong quake could happen any time , right about the January epicentre. "" The Haiti earthquake devastated Port-au-Prince. Buildings destroyed or badly damaged included the presidential palace , the National Assembly building , the cathedral and the main prison , while the list of those killed included the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince , Joseph Serge Miot , the opposition leader , Micha Gaillard , and Hdi Annabi , chief of the United Nations stabilisation mission in Haiti. Since then , a major operation to rebuild the city with international help has been launched , as doctors warn that there is a growing risk of a cholera outbreak in refugee camps. "" What we know hasn ' t brought us any closer to understanding Haiti ' s seismic future , "" Bilham said. "" We can only recommend rebuilding Port-au-Prince as safely as money allows . """
83,"San Francisco ' s 58-story Millennium Tower has sunk 17 inches and tilted 14 inches to the northwest since building started in 2006 , reports 60 Minutes.

The most likely one would involve securing the tower , built on a foundation 80 feet deep in sand , into bedrock , per the Chronicle. But it ' s not clear who would hand over up to $ 150 million necessary for the fix. In addition to lawsuits from residents , Millennium Partners is currently involved in litigation with the nearby Transbay Terminal , which it blames for causing the land beneath the tower to sink. Transbay officials say the tower  which is sinking 1.5 to 2 inches per year , according to one estimate  had already sunk 10 inches before construction on the terminal began , per 60 Minutes.

85,"In the first confirmation of fatalities at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex , the plant  s operator on Sunday announced the recovery of the bodies of two workers who had gone missing after the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Yoshiki Terashima , 21 , and Kazuhiko Kokubo , 24 , had rushed to the turbine room of the No. 4 reactor to inspect the power switches and test the operation valves after the March 11 earthquake. An autopsy revealed that they likely died from the force of impact from the tsunami. Their bodies were found in the building  s basement Wednesday afternoon and had to be decontaminated , the company said , adding the announcement was delayed out of consideration for the families. On Saturday , Tepco said highly radioactive water was leaking from a pit near a reactor into the ocean , which may partly explain the high levels of radioactivity that have been found in seawater off the coast. Advertisement Tepco said it had detected an 8-inch crack in the concrete pit holding power cables near reactor No. 2 and was working to seal the fracture. Tepco said the water was coming directly from the reactor and the radiation level was 1,000 millisieverts an hour. The annual limit of radiation exposure allowed for Fukushima workers is 250 millisieverts. Workers pumped concrete into the shaft Saturday , but by the end of the day the flow of water into the ocean had not diminished. Engineers speculated that the water was preventing the concrete from setting , allowing it to be washed away. Tepco officials said that on Sunday morning they would explore using a polymer  a type of quick-setting plastic  to plug the leak. After spraying thousands of tons of water on the reactors at Fukushima over the last three weeks to keep them from overheating and releasing dangerous amounts of radiation over a wide area , Tepco is faced with the problem of great volumes of contaminated water. With storage tanks at the facility nearing capacity , Tepco is contemplating storing the water in a giant artificial floating island offshore , Kyodo News reported. Tepco , which has been monitoring radiation levels in seawater just offshore from the plant , said it would begin sampling about nine miles off the coast. Workers have also been spraying the grounds of the plant with a polymer in an attempt to prevent any radioactive isotopes that have been deposited there from escaping from the vicinity of the plant. The polymer acts like a kind of super-glue , binding any contaminants to the soil so they cannot be blown away. As 25,000 Japanese and U.S. forces continued an intensive search for corpses along the tsunami-battered coastline of northern Japan , the official death toll climbed to 11,938 and the number of missing fell to 15,748 , the National Police Agency said. The number of people in emergency shelters has declined to about 165,000 from more than 200,000 in the days immediately after the massive earthquake and tsunami March 11. But concerns are growing about the health of elderly residents at the shelters , some of which still lack enough kerosene to run heaters round-the-clock. Many areas of northern Japan are still experiencing subfreezing temperatures. A report Saturday from public broadcaster NHK reported the deaths of some elderly people who had survived the disaster. The broadcaster described harsh conditions facing older survivors , including crowded quarters , interruptions in medical regimens and a discontinuation of services such as physical therapy. In a bit of good news , NHK reported that coast guard officials had found a dog on the roof of a house floating in waters off Miyagi prefecture. The dog , which apparently had been stranded for three weeks , was emaciated and gobbled down sausages and cookies after being saved. julie.makinen@latimes.com Hall is a special correspondent.

It reached Category 5 strength on Nov. 16 , 2020. Whipping winds , torrential downpours , power outages and floods  hurricane season in the Atlantic brings a host of dramatic and dangerous weather with it. But when exactly does the Atlantic hurricane season start and how long does it last ? And what can people do to prepare in the face of the most dangerous storms on Earth ? From hurricane naming conventions to staying safe in a storm , we ' ll detail all you need to know about this year ' s hurricane season. The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is predicted to bring higher-than-average activity , meaning more ferocious storms. What are hurricanes ? Hurricanes are tropical cyclones. When a tropical cyclone ' s sustained winds reach 39 to 73 mph ( 63 to 118 km/h ) , it is considered a tropical storm and it gets a name from a list put out by the World Meteorological Organization. Once those sustained winds reach 74 to 95 mph ( 119 to 153 km/h ) , that storm becomes a Category 1 hurricane. According to the Saffir-Simpson scale , here are the sustained winds linked to categories 2 through 5 hurricanes : Category 2 : 96 to 110 mph ( 154 to 177 km/h ) Category 3 : 111 to 129 mph ( 178 to 208 km/h ) Category 4 : 130 to 156 mph ( 209 to 251 km/h ) Category 5 : 157 mph or higher ( 252 km/h or higher ) Named storms of 2021 Named storms and hurricanes of 2021 : Tropical storm Ana : May 22 , northeast of Bermuda Tropical storm Bill : June 14 , southeast of Halifax , Nova Scotia Tropical storm Claudette : June 17 , Gulf Coast Tropical storm Danny : June 28 , makes landfall just north of Hilton Head on Pritchards Island , South Carolina Hurricane Elsa : July 2 , eastern Caribbean as a Category 1 hurricane How hurricanes form Hurricanes are the most violent storms on Earth , according to NASA. At heart , hurricanes are fueled by just two ingredients : heat and water. Hurricanes are seeded over the warm waters above the equator , where the air above the ocean ' s surface takes in heat and moisture. As the hot air rises , it leaves a lower pressure region below it. This process repeats as air from higher pressure areas moves into the lower pressure area , heats up , and rises , in turn , producing swirls in the air , according to NASA. Once this hot air gets high enough into the atmosphere , it cools off and condenses into clouds. Now , the growing , swirling vortex of air and clouds grows and grows and can become a thunderstorm. So , the first condition needed for hurricanes is warmer waters in the Atlantic Ocean , which cause a number of other conditions favorable to hurricanes. "" When the waters are warmer , it tends to mean you have lower pressures. It means a more unstable atmosphere , which is conducive to hurricanes intensifying , "" said Phil Klotzbach , an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. "" These thunderstorms , which are the building blocks of hurricanes , are better able to organize and get going. "" Another key factor : wind shear , or the change in wind direction with height into the atmosphere , Klotzbach said. "" When you have a warm tropical Atlantic , you have reduced levels of wind shear , "" Klotzbach told Live Science. "" When you have a lot of wind shear it basically tears apart the hurricane. "" ( Storms that form on different sides of the equator have different spin orientations , thanks to Earth ' s slight tilt on its axis , according to NASA. ) How climate patterns affect hurricanes El Nio is associated with above-average equatorial sea-surface temperatures. El Nio ' s signature warmth is apparent in the November 2015 map. ( Image credit : NASA Earth Observatory maps by Joshua Stevens , using data from Coral Reef Watch. ) The individual ingredients for hurricanes , however , don ' t pop up at random ; they are guided by larger weather systems. "" There are two dominant climate patterns that really control the wind and pressure patterns across the Atlantic , "" said Gerry Bell , the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster for NOAA ' s Climate Prediction Center in Washington , D.C. The first is the El Nio/La Nia cycle. During an El Nio , in which ocean water around the northwestern coast of South America becomes warner than usual , Atlantic hurricanes are suppressed , while La Nia creates more favorable conditions for hurricanes , Bell said. The second climate pattern is the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) , which is , as the name implies , a trend that lasts anywhere from 25 to 40 years and is associated with warmer waters in the Atlantic and stronger African monsoons , Bell said. "" When this pattern is in its warm phase , or a warmer tropical Atlantic Ocean , we tend to see stronger hurricane patterns for decades at a time , "" Bell told Live Science. A warm-phase AMO conducive to hurricanes prevailed between 1950 and 1970 and since 1995 , Bell said. Hurricane outlook : 2021 Officially , the Atlantic hurricane season starts on June 1 and runs until Nov. 30. In the Eastern Pacific Ocean , hurricane season begins May 15 and ends Nov. 30 , according to the National Weather Service. However , most of these storms hit during peak hurricane season between August and October , on both coasts , according to the National Weather Service ' s Climate Prediction Center. Following in the footsteps of the record-breaking hurricane season of 2020 , this year is expected to pack a punch , with above-average activity forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . On May 20 , NOAA said there  s a 70 % probability this season will bring a total of 13 to 20 named storms. Of those , six to 10 are expected to reach hurricane status , with up to five of those strengthening into major hurricanes , meaning their winds will whip up to at least 111 mph ( 179 km/h ) . To make their predictions , scientists analyze a host of factors , from wind speed to sea-surface temperatures. Because the El Nio/La Nia cycle typically materializes in summer or early fall , forecasts done too early have limited meaning , Bell said. The Climate Prediction Center classifies hurricane seasons as above-normal ( between 12 and 28 tropical storms and between seven and 15 hurricanes ) ; near-normal ( Between 10 and 15 tropical storms and between four and nine hurricanes ) and below-normal ( Between four and nine tropical storms and two to four hurricanes ) . Are hurricanes getting stronger ? Potential tropical storm Paulette captured on Sept. 23 , after it returned from the dead. ( Image credit : NOAA/NESDIS/STAR GOES-East Band 13 ) Yes. On average , the world is seeing stronger tropical cyclones ( a term that encompasses fast-rotating storms such as hurricanes and typhoons ) more often than in decades past. According to an analysis of 4,000 tropical cyclones from 1979 to 2017 , researchers concluded in 2020 that due to global warming these storms are not only getting stronger , but we are experiencing the strongest of the pack more frequently , Live Science reported. In another study , scientists discovered that compared with six decades ago , hurricanes that blast Bermuda are twice as strong , they reported online Feb. 12 in the journal Environmental Research Letters . We can thank climate change for another hurricane downer : Global warming is leading to so-called zombie storms , or those that peter out and then get refueled to sort of rise from the dead , Live Science reported . For instance , in September 2020 , the Category 1 hurricane Paulette made landfall in Bermuda , strengthened into a Category 2 and then weakened and died out some 5.5 days later. That wasn  t the end of her story , though , because she regained strength and reached tropical storm strength about 300 miles ( 480 kilometers ) off the Azores Islands. And according to scientists , such zombie storms could become more frequent , as waters warm up and give once-dead storms new life , according to Live Science. Which cities have the most hurricanes ? Waves crash on Rodanthe Pier as Hurricane Dorian hits Cape Hatteras in North Carolina on Sept. 6 , 2019. ( Image credit : Jose Luis Magana/AFP via Getty Images ) According to HurricaneCity , a hurricane-tracking website , here are the top 10 cities most frequently hit or affected by hurricanes since record-keeping began in 1871 : Cape Hatteras , North Carolina : Every 1.34 years ( affected by 110 hurricanes since 1871 ) Morehead City , North Carolina : Every 1.52 years Grand Bahamas Island , Bahamas : Every 1.63 years Wilmington , North Carolina : Every 1.69 years Cayman Islands ( most affected area in the Caribbean ) : Every 1.73 years Great Abaco Island , Bahamas : Every 1.81 years Andros Island , Bahamas : Every 1.84 years Bermuda : Every 1.86 years Savannah , Georgia : Every 1.91 years Miami , Florida : Every 1.96 years ( hit 75 times since 1871 ) The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale Once a storm has wind speeds of 38 mph ( 58 km/h ) , it is officially a tropical storm. At 74 mph ( 119 km/h ) , the storm has reached hurricane levels. At that point , scientists use a 1 to 5 scale known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify hurricane strength , with category 1 being the least severe hurricanes and category 5 being the strongest. Some scientists have also proposed adding a category 6 to account for storms that are well beyond the highest sustained wind speed for a category 5 hurricane. Category Sustained wind speed ( mph ) Potential damage 1 74-95 Minimal , with some roof leakage , gutter damage , snapped tree branches and toppled trees with shallow roots 2 96-110 Moderate , with major roof and siding damage ; uprooted trees could block roads ; power loss possible for days to weeks 3 111-129 Devastating damage , with gable and decking damage , many more uprooted trees and extended power outages 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage ; roofs and exterior walls will be destroyed ; trees will snap ; power outages for weeks to months. Large area uninhabitable for weeks or months 5 157 or higher High fraction of framed houses will be destroyed ; power outages for weeks to months ; and huge swaths uninhabitable for same period Source : NOAA ' s National Hurricane Center Some scientists have argued against using just wind speed as a metric to determine a storm ' s severity and potential damage , arguing that other metrics such as storm surge height or rainfall could provide better insight into a storm ' s ferocity. However , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) has argued that metrics like storm surges can be hard to predict because local differences in the shape of the terrain of the ocean floor leading up to the coastline can determine the height of storm surges. How are hurricanes named ? Hurricanes initially were named in honor of the feast day for a Catholic saint. For instance , Hurricane San Felipe occurred on Sept. 13 , 1876 , or the feast day of Saint Phillip , according to the National Hurricane Center. Hurricanes that struck on the same day would be distinguished by a suffix placed on the later one , Live Science previously reported. For example , a storm that struck on Sept. 13 , 1928 , was dubbed Hurricane San Felipe II , to distinguish it from the 1876 storm. However , by the 1950s , the naming convention changed and in the U.S. , hurricanes were given female names based on the international alphabet , according to the NHC. The practice of calling storms by female names only was abandoned in 1978. Despite the seemingly open-ended possibilities , meteorologists do not have free reign in deciding names. The World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) has a long list of alphabetical storm names that repeats on a six-year cycle. The organization aims for clear and simple names. Names are in English , Spanish , Dutch and French , to account for the many languages spoken by people potentially affected by hurricanes. "" Experience shows that the use of short , distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older , more cumbersome , latitude-longitude identification methods. These advantages are especially important in exchanging detailed storm information between hundreds of widely scattered stations , coastal bases and ships at sea , "" the organization says on its website. If a storm was so devastating that using the name again would be insensitive , the group meets and agrees to strike the name from the list. For instance , people don ' t have to worry about facing the wrath of a Hurricane Katrina , Ike , Hattie or Opal again , because those names have been retired , according to the NHC. For the 2021 hurricane season , meteorologists prepared the following list of names for storms in the North Atlantic , Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico , according to the WMO : Ana Bill Claudette Danny Elsa Fred Grace Henri Ida Julian Kate Larry Mindy Nicholas Odette Peter Rose Sam Teresa Victor Wanda How to prepare for a hurricane Staying safe during the hurricane season starts with a simple step : Have a plan. People can plan for hurricanes using a simple guide at Ready.gov. Plans need to be worked out for all family members. And for those animal lovers out there , Fido and Mr. Whiskers also need an escape plan. This plan includes figuring out how to determine whether it ' s safe to hunker down at home during a storm or whether you are in an evacuation zone. If so , there is likely a specific route you should take in the event of an evacuation , as many roads may be closed , Live Science previously reported. If you are in an evacuation zone , you also need to figure out accommodations during the storm  this could be anything from staying with family and friends to renting a motel to staying in a shelter. Family members often have trouble reaching each other during hurricanes , so determining a preset meeting place and protocol can be helpful. Sometimes , local cellphone lines are overloaded during a storm , so consider texting. Another alternative is to have a central out-of-state contact who can relay messages between separated family members. During a storm , pets should be leashed or placed in a carrier , and their emergency supplies should include a list of their vaccinations as well as a photo in case they get lost , according to the Humane Society for the United States. Also important is finding someone who can care for them , in the event that a hotel or shelter does not accept pets. During an emergency , they should also be wearing a collar with the information of an out-of-state contact in case they get separated from you , according to the HSUS. How to storm-proof your home Anyone who lives in a hurricane-prone area would do well to protect their property in advance of a flood. Because hurricanes often cause their damage when trees fall on property , homeowners can reduce the risk of damage by trimming trees or removing damaged trees and limbs , according to Ready.gov. Another easy step is to make sure rain gutters are fixed in place and free of debris. Reinforcing the roof , doors and windows , including a garage door , is also important , according to Ready.gov. Power generators can also be an important tool if the power is cut off for long periods of time. A power generator needs to be kept outside , as they produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. People who are very serious about prevention may even consider building a "" safe room ""  a fortified room designed to withstand the punishing winds of a tornado or hurricane , according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency pamphlet "" Taking Shelter from the Storm : Building a Safe Room for Your Home or Small Business , "" ( FEMA , 2014 ) . List of emergency supplies People living in hurricane country also need to have a stash of emergency supplies , ideally placed in multiple locations throughout a dwelling. According to Ready.gov , a basic disaster kit should include : A gallon of water per person per day for at least three days A three-day supply of non-perishable food A battery-powered or hand-crank radio A flashlight with extra batteries A first aid kit A whistle to get help Dust mask Moist towelettes , garbage cans and plastic ties for sanitation A wrench or pliers for turning off busted pipes Maps A can opener for food And cellphone chargers Originally published on Live Science .|||||Search TFC : Search When searching for a date , please use m/d/yy.

It is just on the Israeli side of the 1949 armistice line with Syria. Susita Mountain , on which Hippos was built , is between the Kinneret Valley and the southwestern Golan mountain range , about 2 kilometers east of the lake and rising 350 meters above it. Hippos was part of the Decapolis , Ten Cities that were culturally tied more closely to Greece and Rome than to the otherwise Semitic region.Archeologists digging at the excavation site , founded as Antioch of Hippos by Seleucid settlers and known as Susita in Hebrew , uncovered a woman  s skeleton and a gold dove-shaped pendant under the tiles of a collapsed roof. In addition , they found the marble leg of a statue and artillery from some 2,000 years ago.Finally the findings are coming together to form a clear historical-archeological picture ,  Dr. Michael Eisenberg , the head of the excavation , said on Monday.The excavation has been ongoing for 15 years. Hippos , which was founded in the second century BCE , was the site of two large , well-documented earthquakes. The first , in 363 CE , caused great damage but the city recovered. The second earthquake , in 749 CE , destroyed the city which was then abandoned , never to recover.Evidence of the 363 CE earthquake  s destruction was uncovered during digging last year , however none as significant as the new discoveries , according to archeologists.In the northern section of the basilica , the largest structure in the city , which served as its marketplace , the archeologists , led by Haim Skolnik , discovered the remains of a number of skeletons that were crushed under the roof that collapsed. Among the bones of one of the women killed in the collapse , they found the dove-shaped pendant.For the first time , evidence was uncovered that the 363 earthquake destroyed the Roman baths , which , like the basilica , were not rebuilt.According to Eisenberg , the findings show that the first earthquake was so powerful it completely destroyed the city , and rebuilding took some 20 years.The marble leg that was discovered was part of a sculpture at the Roman baths. It is too early to determine who the man depicted in the sculpture was. It could be a god or athlete whose sculpture was over 2-meters tall. We hope to find further pieces of the sculpture in the coming seasons that will shed light on his identity ,  Eisenberg said.At the bastion , the city  s main defense post during the Roman period , archeologists uncovered a fortified space for a catapult that appears to have been some 8-meters long. Archeologist have found a number of stone cannonballs that fit the massive catapult , as well as smaller stones for smaller launchers. The catapult was capable of firing cannonballs as far as 350 meters .|||||Make your trip timeless by exploring the country ' s wealth of less-traveled historical sites. The blazing sun overhead bakes the dun-colored , pocked paving stones running along what used to be the main street of Sepphoris , in Israel  s Galilee , where the reconstructed houses provide visitors with a window into the lives of their former inhabitants. At the crest of a hill overlooking the town stands the remains of a restored Roman-era mansion , its interior cool as a cave compared to the dry summer heat outside , its floor decorated with sumptuous mosaics. The pice de rsistance : the bust of a woman framed by garlands  the Mona Lisa of the Galilee. Sepphoris , known also by its Hebrew name , Tzippori , is one of dozens of archaeological sites whose magnificent finds often escape visitors to Israel. The country  s Nature and Parks Authority , however , aims to improve access to these lesser-known spots and draw more visitors to Israel  s often-overlooked ancient gems. The land  s storied history provides it with a unique variety of archaeological sites spanning thousands of years of history. As a crossroads in antiquity , few other places in the world hosted so many civilizations and cultures  Egyptians , Canaanites , Israelites , Assyrians , Babylonians , Persians , Greeks , Romans , Arabs , Crusaders and Turks , to name a few. Each conquest left its marks , which modern archaeologists have meticulously excavated and preserved. So many aspects of Israel are rife with controversy , but one thing almost all visitors agree on with near-universal consensus is that the archaeological sites are not lacking. Tourists might find the streets filthy and the country expensive , as a 2013 Tourism Ministry  s survey showed , but archaeological sites and tour guides found unanimous appeal. The ministry polled just over 33,000 visitors , or roughly 10 percent of the total who entered the country last year , who responded with an average 4.4 out of 5 satisfaction rating for historic places and guides. ( Public cleanliness got a 3.4 and value for cost a mere 3.1. ) In addition to blockbuster sites , such as Masada , Caesarea and Jerusalem  s Old City , the countryside is peppered with fascinating , lesser-known and well-preserved places essential to understanding the land of Israel  s past. King Herod  s royal architectural masterpieces , such as Masada  site of Jewish rebels  last stand against the Romans in 73 C.E.  and Caesarea , his royal capital and port , boast hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Off-the-beaten-path locales offer greater insight into the day-to-day of ancient life , and a respite from the roads more traveled. Long neglected , some of these lower-tier sites are set to start receiving critical government funding to develop them as greater tourist attractions. Tsvika Tsuk , chief archaeologist of the Nature and Parks Authority , said in a recent interview that the government  s Tamar heritage project aims to develop archaeological sites not for archaeological excavation but for interpretation , mostly from the Jewish point of view.  The project , approved in 2010 , will pump roughly NIS 120 million ( $ 35 million ) into transforming historically Jewish sites , including Herodion , Beit She  arim , Megiddo , Arad , Sepphoris , Hamat Tiberias and Lachish , into stronger tourist attractions. The parks authority will use the funds to reconstruct central elements of the sites , such as the Iron Age temple at Arad and a synagogue at Hamat Tiberias , as well as visitors  centers and site interpretation  the manner in which a place  s historic relevance is conveyed to tourists. The parks authority  s master plan also includes equally impressive sites that are almost wholly undeveloped. One such site is Hippos , also known as Susita in Hebrew , an ancient Roman town in the Golan Heights. Perched on a precipitous plateau above the Sea of Galilee , the once grand community of Hippos lies in ruin. The volcanic , grey basalt stone used for much of the city  s construction makes the entire site appear to be an old photograph come to life , until you lift your eyes and see the brilliant cerulean of the Kinneret below. Roman historian Pliny the Elder refers to Hippos as one of a handful of pleasant towns  on the Kinneret  s eastern shore , and one of the 10 Greek cities straddling the Jordan Valley known as the Decapolis. Its sister city , Beth Shean , lies just to the south , and is home to some of the best-preserved Roman architecture in the country. Hippos was destroyed by an earthquake in 749 C.E. , and today the pillars of its churches and temples and the walls of its homes strew the ground. Despite its desolation , the main street remains intact  and better paved than some in Jerusalem , Tel Aviv or Philadelphia. After over a decade of excavations , archaeologists have uncovered a once-bustling forum and a Greek theater , both evidence of the Hellenistic city that once thrived under Roman rule. Adjoining the forum  the social and economic heart of the city  stands the remains of the basilica , a many-columned public building whose capitals rest atop stumps of their former selves. Although it is a short drive from some of the major Christian and Jewish attractions around the lake , few tourists , if any , venture to Hippos. Hippos , along with a handful of other historic treasures , like the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Shivta , south of Beersheva , are on a short list of parks authority sites the government aims to develop. Those places are not well developed now ,  but are part of our program for the future ,  Tsuk said. The Galilee  long an epicenter for Jewish thought and culture  retains some fragments of its glorious past , but the Negev Desert , Israel  s southern expanse , is also home to an untold multitude of archaeological sites virtually unknown to the ordinary visitor. Which is where people like Steve Rubin come in. Rubin , a Philadelphia native who is a licensed Israeli tour guide. With the jawline of a young Tom Cruise and the air of a Harrison Ford character , I half expect him to break out a fedora as we sit for coffee. He says he aims to bring some of the passed-over sites , in Israel  s South in particular , out of obscurity. He lamented the comparative difficulty for tourists to access the more remote sites Israel has to offer. When travelers seek to explore the far-flung locales in Jordan , Turkey or Egypt , he noted , a multitude of guides are on hand to hawk their services for transporting , feeding and watering customers during the trek , and to share their intimacy with the place. While major sites such as Masada and Caesarea are conveniently accessible , Israeli services allowing travelers to visit remote treasures are limited. Websites offering tourist services for these sites abound , but if you  re looking for information about it in English , there  s nothing there ,  Rubin said. There  s a whole sector of archaeological tourism that  s waiting to be developed.  One such diamond in the rough is situated near Israel  s border with Egypt , roughly halfway between the Gaza Strip and Eilat : Mount Karkom. More than 20 miles from the nearest town and surrounded by Israel Defense Forces firing ranges , the mountain was a Paleolithic cult center , and is covered with ancient shrines , altars and tens of thousands of petroglyphs and geoglyphs  giant icons in stone visible from the air , like the Nazca Lines of Peru. Rubin aspires to help revolutionize the industry and bring inaccessible sites like Mount Karkom into reach for tourists. Israel has the rare fortune to sit at the crossroads of civilizations , and possesses a diverse multitude of cultural relics in an excellent state of preservation ,  he explained. At this point , we  re only showcasing a tiny fraction of what there is to offer.  Israeli cities are also investing huge sums in developing their historic districts. While the Tourism Ministry survey published earlier this year found that the vast majority of travelers visited old Jerusalem and Jaffa , other , less-frequented cities are trying to put themselves on the map. Ramle , for example , is situated just 10 miles from downtown Tel Aviv , and was founded in the early eighth century as the first Arab capital in ancient Palestine. It served as the largest and most important city in the region during much of the Muslim period. Having fallen into disrepair over the centuries , Ramle now boasts a revitalized open-air market and restored buildings exhibiting paragons of Islamic architecture from a variety of periods. It  s probably the best way to see a microcosm of Israel with its multifaceted cultural and religious face ,  Rubin asserted. All of the major sites can be visited on a walking tour. History , food , culture , location and archaeology make it the perfect way to see the history of the Holy Land over the last 1,300 years. Whenever people finish a day in Ramle , they  re usually shocked about how they never knew it was such an historically and culturally rich place to visit.  For a country reliant on tourism for roughly 6 percent of its gross domestic product , Israel stands to gain immensely from developing untapped parts of its rich cultural heritage. As it does , a vista into the land  s broad array of historic landmarks will open up for visitors to enjoy. Ilan Ben Zion is a reporter for the Times of Israel. This is his first Inside piece.

88,"North Korea has taken the unprecedented step of writing to the Australian Parliament in a blistering letter that demonises US President Donald Trump and which offers Australia "" assurances of its highest consideration "" . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop , who revealed the existence of the "" unprecedented "" letter to Fairfax Media on Thursday , said the missive was a clear sign international diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear program and repeated tests of inter-continental ballistic missiles was beginning to work. The letter was written by the powerful Foreign Affairs Committee of the DPRK Supreme People ' s Assembly and sent via North Korea ' s embassy in Jakarta to Australia ' s Indonesian embassy on September 28. From there , it made its way to Ms Bishop a week later. North Korea has repeatedly threatened the United States , Japan , South Korea , Australia and other Western allies , warning last week after Ms Bishop ' s visit to South Korea that Australia would face "" disaster "" if it continued to "" follow the US in imposing military , economic and diplomatic pressure upon the DPRK "" .|||||A 38 North exclusive with analysis by Frank V. Pabian and Jack Liu. There have now been three detected and reported earthquake-like events subsequent to the most recent , very large ( ~6.1 magnitude ) underground nuclear test conducted by North Korea on September 3 , 2017 at its Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site. Recent media reporting has suggested that , as a result , the site may no longer be suitable for further underground nuclear testing. The three earthquakes were likely induced by the ~250 kiloton nuclear test ; however , US nuclear test history at the Nevada Test Site provides evidence that such post-test tremors are not unusual. Furthermore , even in the face of what has been dubbed Tired Mountain Syndrome ,  [ 1 ] abandonment of the site for nuclear testing should not be expected. Such historical precedent , combined with the presence of two other , as yet unused tunnel complexes within the test site , leads us to conclude that there is no valid reason to assume that the Punggye-ri test site is unable to contain additional underground nuclear tests. Figure 1. An interferometric SAR ( InSAR ) derived graphic , obtained through the processing of radar imagery from the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 ( ALOS-2 ) of the area encompassing the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site , overlain on Google Earth. The overall centralization of the radar-detected displacements encompassing all of Mt. Mantap provides additional empirical evidence that the sixth nuclear test occurred directly under the peak. Note that pixels with correlation less than 0.1 are transparent. Background On September 3 , 2017 , a 4.6 magnitude earthquake-like event was detected at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site only eight minutes after North Korea  s sixth and largest underground nuclear test had been conducted. Its seismic waveform , together with the nominal five kilometers  depth , rule out a nuclear test explosion ( the likely deepest depth of burial under Mt. Mantap is 800 meters , see Figure 1 ) . It has generally been speculated that the first post-test earthquake-like event was somehow related to a structural collapse or cave-in , but this remains unverified at this time. Another similar event of 3.5 magnitude having earthquake characteristics  was detected at essentially the same location on September 23. Most recently , on October 12 , a 2.9 magnitude earthquake with similar waveform and depth ( ~5 kilometers ) was detected.[ 2 ] These three earthquakes were not caused by human intervention and hence were not related to new nuclear testing. Moreover , in terms of scale , all three earthquakes were smaller ( two significantly so ) in magnitude than North Korea  s second nuclear test in 2009 , which had a magnitude of 4.7 and an estimated explosive yield of about 5 kilotons. Media Speculation on Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site  s Unsuitability As a result of these nuclear test-induced earthquakes , new media reporting has appeared with headlines such as North Korea  s Nuclear Test Site Could Be Unstable  and Has N. Korea nuked itself out of a nuclear test site ?  While these do make for eye-catching headlines , there was little substance in the articles to back them up beyond quoting the speculative fears of civilian experts.  Nonetheless , based on the severity of the initial blast , the post-test tremors , and the extent of observable surface disturbances , [ 3 ] we have to assume that there must have been substantial damage to the existing tunnel network under Mt. Mantap. If North Korea were to attempt to continue testing under this mountain ( such as , in the area more to the eastern side ) , then we would expect to see new tunneling in the future near the North Portal , still under Mt. Mantap. A lack of new tunneling in this area would provide evidence that this mountain has been abandoned for future testing. However , complete abandonment of the test site as a whole remains unlikely. For comparative purposes , we can look to the US Nevada Test Site  s experience with multiple underground tests. A United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) report on nuclear test-induced earthquakes conducted at this site concluded :  increases in seismic activity in the Nevada region were common following underground nuclear explosions at the US Nevada Test Site with equivalent seismic magnitude of 5.0 or greater. Periods of time before and after 21 explosions were examined. Most of the increased activity appears to have originated within 20 kilometers of the test shot-point. The time history of this activity indicates that it was directly related to the nuclear explosions. Most of the seismic events ( earthquakes ) following underground tests were very small. The decay of post-shot activity and its relationships to the equivalent magnitude of the explosion provided confirmation of the determinative ( causal ) role of the nuclear event. For the most part , this activity was confined to the test site.[ 4 ] However , despite the numerous post-test earthquakes , the Nevada Test Site was not abandoned for nuclear test purposes until the nuclear test moratorium that took effect in October 1992. At Punggye-ri , the presence of two other test tunnel complexes , accessible via the South and West Portals , provides sufficient means to continue testing at the site irrespective of test-induced effects to Mt. Mantap. Conclusion Nuclear tests previously conducted at the US Nevada Test Site ( as well as at the former Soviet nuclear test sites ) show that test-induced seismic events ( small post-test earthquakes ) , associated with tests having magnitudes of 5.0 or more , are not unusual. Moreover , such activity did not lead to site abandonment prior to the general test moratorium in 1992. Because Mt. Mantap has been the location for the last five of six of North Korea  s declared underground nuclear tests ( via the North Portal ) and has undergone widespread observable surface disturbances resulting from the most recent test , it is not surprising that there were a number of post-test earthquakes. This may have caused some concern both inside and outside North Korea about Tired Mountain Syndrome.  For the time being , however , given the presence of additional test portals , we see no reason that the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site as a whole has or will be abandoned for future underground nuclear testing .|||||by &#124; &#124; Last week was pretty awesome  we had a huge new tools  conference here at Monterey with all kinds of cool space and tech companies like Airbus. We have a great relationship with Airbus , which made available a pair of images taken with synthetic aperture radar of North Korea  s nuclear test site before and after the most recent nuclear test. SAR is cool. You can see that the explosion visibly displaces the mountain , which demonstrates both how large the explosion was but also that it occurred in the same tunnel complex as the preceding four nuclear tests. This is useful because the relationship between the size of the explosion and the magnitude of the seismic signals is sensitive to the overburden  how much rock is above the explosion. We are very grateful that Airbus provided the imagery and pretty excited to share it with you.  Jeffrey Lewis Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR ) Imagery of North Korea  s Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site Catherine Dill , Melissa Hanham , Catherine Hartley , Jeffrey Lewis , Lars Petersen , Allison Puccioni , and David Schmerler On 3 September 2017 at noon , local time , North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear explosion at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test site. The magnitude of the explosion , as measured by seismic stations around the world , was an order of magnitude larger than past tests. The CTBTO estimates the size of the explosion , using the magnitude moment scale , at 6.07. The explosion was powerful enough that a secondary seismic event was detected , probably related to a collapse of the cavity created by the nuclear explosion. While seismic signals can tell us about the size of the explosion , determining the location of the explosion is much more difficult. It is , however , possible to use Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR ) satellites to observe environmental changes as a result of this explosion and to locate where the explosion may have occurred. Radar satellite imagery , collected by the TerraSAR-X satellite , reveals a major ground disturbance and subsidence of the peak of Mount Mantap. This suggests that the explosion occurred within the tunnel complex at Mount Mantap , where North Korea also conducted its most recent four nuclear tests in 2009 , 2013 and 2016. North Korea  s nuclear test site comprises a number of tunnel complexes in mountains surrounding a main support area. Following an initial nuclear explosion in 2006 , subsequent nuclear tests have been conducted in a tunnel complex to the North of the support area , under Mt. Mantap. The site contains additional tunnel complexes that may be suitable for nuclear explosions to the south and west of the support area. The Punggye-ri site is capable of hosting nuclear explosions in tunnels with yields of up to a few hundred kilotons. Unlike conventional satellite imagery which measures visible light , radar satellites measures X-band microwaves , which can detect geo-precise surface changes when collected and processed together. The German TerraSAR-X satellite uses X-band microwaves with a 3.1 cm wavelength , which in this case , provides 1 meter spatial resolution of the targeted site , however , due to the short wavelength , does not penetrate trees and other vegetation enough to measure the exact earth subsidence. Airbus , the owner of the commercial exploitation rights of the satellite , tasked TerraSAR-X to record imagery of North Korea  s nuclear test site at Punggye-ri before and after the 3 September nuclear test. The satellite imaged the nuclear test site from the same orbital position on differing dates resulting in a pair of geo-precise images from 26 August and 06 September 2017. Preliminary imagery interpretation concludes the peak itself of Mount Mantap has incurred a visible amount of subsidence ; and over 85 acres of the southwest flank of the mountain was displaced by several meters. The image pair was overlaid and compared ; revealing significant changes at Mount Mantap  s peak elevation. Prior to the test , Mount Mantap was 2,205 meters high ; the mountain has since diminished in height. This subsidence suggests that North Korea conducted yet another test in the tunnel complex under Mt. Mantap despite excavation continuing on an additional tunnel complex to the west of the support area. The subsidence also demonstrates the magnitude of the event. Similar images were collected before and after North Korea  s January 2016 nuclear test but showed no such ground disturbance. Previously , optical satellite images from Planet Labs had shown localized landslides in the Mount Mantap  s fluvial plain around the Northern Test Portal at Punggye-ri . The displacement and subsidence suggests that the explosion occurred within the tunnel complex under Mount Mantap , which offers overburdens up to 900 meters. If the explosion occurred underneath 900 meters of rock , then it could have been in excess of 300 kilotons  although the North Korean nuclear test site is poorly calibrated and such calculations are sensitive to estimates of how deeply the test was buried.* * Yield estimation for a nuclear explosion at Punggye-ri , DPRK is done using the formula : Mb = 1.0125 log ( Y )  0.7875 log ( H ) + 5.887 , where the depth of burial ( H ) is in meters and the yield ( Y ) is in kilotons.

90,"It ' s been 30 years since NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope on April 24 , 1990. The observatory was carried aloft in the payload bay of space shuttle Discovery , and for three decades Hubble ' s history was closely intertwined with the shuttle ' s. The telescope was originally scheduled for launch in 1986 , but the tragic Challenger accident at the start of that year led to a four-year delay. When Hubble finally made it into orbit , it still wasn ' t smooth sailing. Almost immediately , scientists discovered a serious flaw in the telescope ' s mirror that made stars look slightly blurred , rather than like sharp pinpoints of light. Since the whole point of putting Hubble above the Earth ' s atmosphere was to avoid the blurring that ground-based telescopes suffer from , this was disastrously bad news. For any other astronomical satellite the situation would have been mission-ending , but not for Hubble , which was designed all along to be serviceable in space  another way its destiny was inextricably tied to the shuttle. Related : The Hubble Space Telescope and 30 years that transformed our view of the universe The first servicing flight , by space shuttle Endeavour in December 1993 , was originally planned as a routine maintenance visit. Instead it became an urgent rescue mission. In a series of tense spacewalks , the astronauts replaced Hubble ' s main camera with a redesigned one and installed a corrective optics package for the other instruments. In what may be the second greatest feat of human spaceflight ( after the moon landings ) , Hubble was brought back up to its design spec. Now it could see all the wonders of the universe with a clarity that could never be achieved from Earth ' s surface. Four subsequent servicing missions , the last by space shuttle Atlantis in May 2009 , have ensured Hubble remains the world ' s most powerful telescope to this day. As dark as the night sky looks from ground level , it never gets completely black due to airglow in the atmosphere , which limits the ability of earthbound astronomers to take long-exposure photographs. At Hubble ' s high altitude , however , the background sky really is pitch black , which means it can see incredibly faint objects if it stares at the same patch of sky for long enough. That ' s the rationale behind one of Hubble ' s most impressive achievements : the series of ' deep-field ' images , of which the first was released in 1996 and the most recent  the Hubble Extreme Deep Field ( HXDF )  in 2012. "" Before Hubble , we knew essentially nothing about galaxies in the first half of the life of the universe , "" Garth Illingworth , one of the scientists behind the project , told All About Space. "" That ' s the first 7 billion years of the universe ' s 13.8-billion-year life. Now Hubble , through remarkable surveys like HXDF , has probed into the era of the first galaxies. "" Through this type of work , Hubble has discovered galaxies like GN-z11 , the most distant discovered by Hubble. "" Just 400 million years after the Big Bang , Hubble is looking back through 97 % of all time to see GN-z11 , far outstripping what can be done with the biggest telescopes on the ground. "" Although Hubble is best known for the spectacular images taken with its cameras , these are complemented by other , equally important instruments in the form of spectrographs. The latter add a whole new dimension , Hubble ' s senior project scientist Jennifer Wiseman said. "" The spectrum taken with the STIS spectrograph on Hubble tells you about the composition of the gases and the material in the system , and the motions of the material as well. Having cameras and spectrographs gives you a very powerful combination of scientific tools. "" Perhaps the most dramatic use of Hubble ' s spectrographs  and one that few astronomers would have envisioned when it was launched 30 years ago  is in exploring the atmospheres of recently discovered exoplanets around distant stars. "" This technique called transmission spectroscopy has been leveraged about 100 times , "" Nikole Lewis , an exoplanet specialist at Cornell University , told All About Space. "" We can actually look at starlight filtered through those planet atmospheres to find out something about what ' s in the air around these planets beyond our solar system. "" It ' s particularly exciting to find traces of chemicals which , on Earth , we associate with life  water being the most obvious one. Hubble made headlines in 2019 with the first discovery of water in the atmosphere of an Earth-size exoplanet , K2-18b , which orbits in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star. In its 30 years in space , the Hubble Space Telescope has contributed to every aspect of astronomy  from our own solar system to the most distant galaxies  and more than 15,000 scientific papers have been published detailing its results. These include many exciting new discoveries , including evidence of the supermassive black holes lurking in the centers of galaxies. One Hubble scientist , Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) , which operates Hubble in partnership with NASA , was awarded a share of the 2011 Nobel Prize for his part in observations that the universe ' s expansion is accelerating , suggesting the presence of mysterious dark energy. NASA astronaut Kathy Thornton accesses Hubble repair equipment during the first servicing mission , in 1993. ( Image credit : NASA ) As the senior project scientist for Hubble , it ' s Jennifer Wiseman ' s job to keep track of the full range of Hubble ' s scientific activities in different areas of astronomy. "" Thirty years into the mission , the scientific productivity of Hubble is at an all-time high , "" she told All About Space. "" The reason is that the servicing missions , especially the final one in 2009 , have been very successful , keeping Hubble very fit for great observations and cutting-edge science. Clever new observing techniques developed by Hubble scientists have boosted new discoveries as well. And the outstanding expert operations team on the ground  engineers , technicians , managers and computer support  keep diligent watch over Hubble ' s subsystems to keep science return at a maximum as Hubble ages. "" So what ' s the payoff for the scientific community ? "" Currently there are almost a thousand science papers published every year based on data from Hubble , "" Wiseman said. "" That ' s more than ever before. About half of these are based on data taken from the Hubble archive. This is fantastic. It means that data originally taken for one scientific purpose is being used again for a different scientific purpose  a great return on investment ! "" Some of the scientists who work with Hubble today were still at school  or not even born  when it was launched 30 years ago , while others have been closely involved with it throughout that time. In the latter category is Colin Norman , a senior staff member at STScI who watched Hubble ' s launch from Cape Canaveral , Florida , in April 1990. "" Hubble has changed the landscape of astronomy and astrophysics , "" he said. "" It has far exceeded its early goals  no other science facility has ever made such a range of fundamental discoveries. It ' s been a privilege to be associated with this effort that has become embedded in the culture of our time. "" That last point is an interesting one. For all its groundbreaking scientific discoveries , Hubble ' s most unique achievement is arguably the inspirational impact it ' s had on the general public. It would be an understatement to say it ' s the most famous telescope in history. Before Hubble , people without a special interest in astronomy probably couldn ' t have named a single telescope. Yet today ' Hubble ' is a household name , instantly recognizable to people all over the world and a symbol of both the brilliance of human ingenuity and the wonders of the universe. What ' s the reason for Hubble ' s uniquely iconic status ? "" It reads like a movie script ; it has a story arc , "" Ray Villard , STScI ' s news director , said. "" The anticipation of launch , the optical failure , redemption with the servicing missions  then more drama when it was cancelled in the last decade. "" Fortunately that cancellation was averted , and Hubble is still with us  hopefully for many years to come. As Villard says , "" Well toward 2030 we ' re back to doing some of the best science we think we can ever do with Hubble.

( Image credit : NASA/ESA/STScI ) With a captivating new photo , the "" Cosmic Reef , "" NASA ' s Hubble Space Telescope showcases the instruments ' incredible capabilities on its 30th anniversary. Thirty years ago today ( April 24 ) , Hubble launched into space on a mission to open humanity ' s eyes to the wonders of the cosmos. In a new Hubble image released today , the telescope captured two neighboring clouds of cosmic dust and gas : the giant red nebula NGC 2014 and a smaller blue nebula nearby called NGC 2020. Hubble scientists named the image "" Cosmic Reef , "" because the sparkling , brilliant structures resemble a cosmic coral reef glistening in some secret corner of a deep ocean. This image was taken by Hubble ' s Wide Field Camera 3 to mark the telescope ' s 30 years in space. "" This image is amazing , it ' s really showing how powerful Hubble is , "" Elena Sabbi , an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute , told Space.com. "" Today , it has the sharpest eyes it ' s ever had. "" Video : Beautiful nebulas in ' never-before-seen ' Hubble 30th anniversary view Related : The best Hubble Space Telescope images of all time ! These brilliant star birthplaces are part of the much larger star-forming region the Large Magellanic Cloud , a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. NGC 2014 is made up of a shimmering collection of bright stars , each 10 to 20 times more massive than our sun. Meanwhile , NGC 2020 is made up of a single , enormous star that is about 200,000 times brighter than our sun. NGC 2014 also has that distinct bubbly , coral-like appearance. This is created when massive stars in the nebula release intense stellar winds , or streams of charged particles , that push away lower-density gases , Hubble scientists said in a statement. The large nebula also has a few blue spots which match its smaller neighboring nebula. These blue areas are created by oxygen that has been super-heated by ultraviolet light to about 20,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( about 11,093 degrees Celsius ) . Since NGC 2020 contains just one brilliant star , its blue tones are created a little bit differently. The blue gas seen in this nebula was ejected by this star during a number of events in which the star blew off part of its outer envelope and released this gas as it reaches the end of its life. "" It is very very hard to be a star in a star cluster , "" Sabbi said about NGC 2020. "" It ' s 50 times more massive than the sun , has been kicked from the nursery it ' s now zooming through the Magellanic cloud at 46,000 miles per hour and this star is approaching the end of its life , so it ' s already losing its external envelope.

"" The stunning detail captured from 163,000 light-years away shows just how powerful Hubble is. Since it launched in 1990 , the space telescope has made over 1.4 million observations of over 47,000 celestial objects , producing over 164 terabytes of data and leading to over 17,000 scientific papers and counting. Observations made with Hubble confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies and even led to the discovery of dark energy. Using Hubble observations , scientists were also able to create the best 3D maps of dark matter , showing how the mysterious matter is distributed throughout the universe. Hubble has discovered some of Pluto ' s moons and provided new information about protoplanetary disks ( the disks of gas and dust that surround a star and form planets and celestial objects ) and gamma-ray bursts , the strongest and brightest explosions in the universe. The space telescope has even captured the moment when the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter in 1994. Hubble ' s observations have led to an incredible wealth of discovery and exploration. But , even more so than just scientific discovery , the images collected by Hubble opened humanity ' s eyes to what really lies out in the universe. For the first time , people could see in stunning detail what nebulas look like "" up close , "" or how the planet ' s in our solar system are patterned with incredible clouds and structures. "" I think , maybe in my opinion , the coolest thing , "" former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino , who flew on the last two servicing missions to the telescope , recently told Space.com about Hubble , is "" it takes us places we could only dream about going and shows us the beauty of the universe that ' s out there.

91,"U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters prior to departing for Paris , France , from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington , U.S. , November 9 , 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ( Reuters ) - President Donald Trump early on Saturday said gross mismanagement of forests  is to blame for two unchecked wildfires burning in California , where nine people have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced to evacuate. There is no reason for these massive , deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor ,  he wrote in a Twitter post. Billions of dollars are given each year , with so many lives lost , all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now , or no more Fed payments ! ,  he added .|||||President Donald Trump woke up in Paris on Saturday in the mood to make threats toward California as it deals with deadly wildfires in Northern California and hundreds of smoldering homes in Southern California. In an angry tweet , the president threatened to pull federal funding for the state if nothing is done to "" remedy "" the situation. Trump was in Paris to take part in a commemoration for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. But his mind was still on the disaster unfolding out west in the U.S. On Sunday , California Gov. Jerry Brown ' s office fired back , calling the president ' s tweet "" inane and uninformed. "" "" Our focus is on the Californians impacted by these fires and the first responders and firefighters working around the clock to save lives and property  not on the president  s inane and uninformed tweets , "" Evan Westrup , the governor ' s press secretary , told ABC News. At least 25 people have been killed this week as flames from the wildfires engulfed their vehicles , homes and neighborhoods in Northern California , authorities said. There were more than 100 people missing in the region but by Saturday officials added that at least 70 people who were reported missing were located and are now safe. Brown requested a presidential major disaster declaration to "" bolster the ongoing emergency response and help residents recover from devastating fires burning in Butte , Los Angeles and Ventura counties , "" his office announced on Sunday. The president approved an emergency declaration for the state on Friday  but warned he may not do the same in the future. Emergency declarations provide municipalities with air support , relief supplies and evacuation transport. Fire officials said Trump ' s statements , and remedies , were incorrect. One leading California fire official on Saturday called Trump ' s comments "" a shameful attack on California. "" "" The president  s assertion that California  s forest management policies are to blame for catastrophic wildfire is dangerously wrong , "" California Professional Firefighters President Brian K. Rice said in a statement on Saturday. "" Wildfires are sparked and spread not only in forested areas but in populated areas and open fields fueled by parched vegetation , high winds , low humidity and geography , "" he continued in the statement. "" Moreover , nearly 60 percent of California forests are under federal management , and another two-thirds under private control. It is the federal government that has chosen to divert resources away from forest management , not California. "" "" Natural disasters are not red  or blue   they destroy regardless of party , "" Rice concluded. "" Right now , families are in mourning , thousands have lost homes , and a quarter-million Americans have been forced to flee. At this desperate time , we would encourage the president to offer support in word and deed , instead of recrimination and blame. "" On Saturday evening , Trump changed course , tweeting support for the firefighters , the homeowners and the tragic victims of the west coast wildfires. "" God bless them all , "" the president tweeted. But on Sunday he tweeted about mismanagement again , writing , "" With proper Forest Management , we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart ! "" Trump has made similar false claims about fire science and government resource allocation in the past , and fire officials have pushed back. In August he tweeted , "" California wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren  t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading ! "" "" We have plenty of water to fight these fires , "" Deputy Cal Fire Chief Scott McLean said in a statement in August. Nevertheless , the Trump administration announced it would override the Endangered Species Act to provide extra water -- not needed by the fire crews. He also criticized California ' s handling of forest fires at an Oct. 17 Cabinet meeting. During an exchange with Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue , Trump called California "" a mess "" and "" disgraceful. "" "" I say to the governor , or whoever is going to be the governor , of California : You better get your act together , "" Trump said. "" Because California , we ' re just not going to continue to pay the kind of money that we ' re paying because of fires that should never be to the extent [ they are ] . "" Trump has long feuded with Brown , a Democrat , who is set to be replaced by fellow Trump antagonist Gavin Newsom. The Democrat was elected to the office last week. Newsom was previously married to former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle , who now dates Donald Trump Jr. "" It ' s costing our country hundreds of billions of dollars because of incompetence in California , "" Trump said in that Cabinet meeting. It ' s unclear where Trump was getting the figure of "" hundreds of billions of dollars. "" Cal Fire ' s operating budget for 2018-19 is $ 2.3 billion. Fire Management Assistance Grants , authorized through the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , refund as much as 75 percent of firefighting costs for departments. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development also provided $ 212 million to the state of California in 2017. Trump ' s tweet ironically comes while he is in Paris , the namesake of the Paris Climate Agreement , under which nearly 200 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change. The agreement was signed by the U.S. during Barack Obama ' s administration , but Trump pulled the country out of the agreement in June 2017. Michael Mann , an atmospheric science professor at Penn State University , told PBS ' "" NewsHour "" in August that he believes climate change is contributing to the increased seriousness of wildfires. "" We ' re not saying that climate change is literally causing the events to occur , "" he said. "" What we can conclude with a great deal of confidence now is that climate change is making these events more extreme. "" ABC News ' Stephanie Ebbs contributed to this report ."
92,"With Hurricane Irene barreling towards New York , the MTA said it may close the city  s entire mass transit system , officials said this afternoon. The decision to stop buses , the subway and trains would be made if high winds and torrential rain became too dangerous to continue service , jittery transit officials said. Because of the severity of the wind and rain associated with a hurricane , there may be partial or full shut down of our services to ensure the safety of our customers and employees ,  the MTA said in a statement. PHOTOS : HURRICANE IRENE MYFOXHURRICANE : FOLLOW IRENE NYC OEM : HURRICANE EVACUATION ZONE FINDER OBAMA DISCUSSES HURRICANE IRENE WHILE VACATIONING NYSE PLANS TO OPEN MONDAY , HAS IRENE CONTINGENCY PLAN EAST COAST REFINERIES LIKELY TO SHUT AS HURRICANE IRENE NEARS IRENE WREAKS HAVOR OFF FLORIDA COAST , 9 HURT We are also prepared to implement evacuation plans if the Mayor and Governor decide that is necessary.  Mayor Bloomberg said he expected the city would shut down its entire transit system at some point Saturday afternoon , with buses subways and trains unlikely to be available again until sometime Monday and perhaps later , depending on the extent of damage. The system can  t be safely operated with sustained winds of 39 mph or more , said Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Jay Walder. Trains and buses must cease normal operations at least eight hours before those winds arrive , in order to move all MTA equipment from low-lying storage areas and secure trains in protected areas , including in the system  s underground tunnels , he said. To prep for the storm  which could hit this weekend  the MTA is bringing in extra workers , clearing drains and establishing plans to move equipment and supplies away from low-lying areas. Irene was expected to have a crippling impact on travel throughout the US East Coast this weekend , with Amtrak announcing it had canceled all of its trains operating south of Washington , D.C. , on Friday , Saturday , and Sunday. If the storm strikes New York , it will probably be a Category 1 or 2 , depending on its exact track , hurricane specialist John Cangialosi said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie asked all visitors to the shore to get out by midday Friday. He said Irene was poised to be a serious , significant event ,  with flooding a threat across the entire state. A mandatory evacuation was ordered for Cape May County. New York is especially susceptible with its large subway network and the waterways around the city , Mayfield said. In many ways , a Category 2 or stronger storm hitting New York is a lot of people  s nightmare ,  said Susan Cutter , director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. High water in the harbor and rivers , along with a high tide at the end of the month because of the new moon , could cause serious flooding. New York  s three airports are close to the water , putting them at risk , too , Cutter said. And if the storm shifts further to the west , placing New York City on the stronger right-hand quadrant of the storm , that is what  s going to push this wall of water into the bays and the Hudson River.  At the same time , Gov , Cuomo today declared a state of emergency in New York in preparation for the potential impact this weekend. A state of emergency allows New York to use state resources to assist local governments more effectively and quickly. In this emergency I am activating all levels of state government to prepare for any situation that may be caused by Hurricane Irene ,  Cuomo said. We are communicating with our federal and local partners to track the storm and to plan a coordinated response , and we will deploy resources as needed to the areas expected to be hit the hardest.  Hurricane Irene will likely wallop the city and Long Island with winds of up to 50 mph and 4 to 8 inches of rain this weekend. Irene  s strong winds and heavy rains threaten to deliver long-lasting power outages to millions of customers along the East Coast , utility officials and weather forecasters say. High winds are the biggest threat to utility wires and poles. Recent heavy rains in the region have made trees even more vulnerable to toppling over. Flooding can cause problems for power plants , which are often located near rivers or other bodies of water. The path and strength of the storm is still uncertain. However , utilities are preparing for the possibility that outages will be widespread and lengthy. It  s going to be really tough ,  says Karen Johnson , a spokesperson for PSE&G , which serves 2.2 million customers in New Jersey. She recommends customers stock up on supplies of food and water before the storm hits. You could conceivably have millions of people without power ,  said Matt Rogers , President of Commodity Weather Group , which forecasts weather effects on businesses. Weather watchers nudged Irene  s track a bit farther east yesterday afternoon , predicting that Irene  s eye  the center of the storm  will pass over Montauk , bringing winds between 90 and 110 mph. Suffolk County officials announced a voluntary evacuation of beach towns on western Fire Island on Thursday. They say that could become mandatory on Friday. Officials are asking ferry companies not to bring anyone to the island who doesn  t own a home there. Campers at county parks are being asked to take a hike. In Nassau County , residents on the Barrier Island on the south shore were told to prepare for evacuations unless the storm changes its track. Emergency shelters are being set up around the island and residents are urged to pack kits with emergency supplies. The Long Island Rail Road is reducing service in advance of the hurricane and officials say a total shutdown is possible. Heavy rainfall is expected to start after midnight Saturday night and last until Sunday evening. Accuweather.com reported that Irene could be a once-in-50-year  hurricane for the Northeast , where Mayor Bloomberg said Thursday his city was taking the storm very seriously. Bloomberg said people living in the city  s so-called Zone-A  might need to evacuate ahead of the storm. That zone includes neighborhoods along the coast , including Battery Park City in lower Manhattan , Coney Island in Brooklyn and Far Rockaway in Queens. The Office of Emergency Management said residents in that zone face the highest risk  of flooding from a hurricane  s storm surge. See if that long-lost cousin will put you up overnight ,  said Bloomberg. For those who do not have relatives who are so accommodating , Bloomberg said the city will have set up shelters for the 270,000 people who may be affected. The areas [ affected by the storm ] are , in the context of the city , relatively small ,  he said. Bloomberg said the evacuation is voluntary , and only if the storm worsens would he issue an executive order forcing people to flee. The city will make that decision by 8 a.m. Saturday. Bloomberg did order the five hospitals in the low-lying areas of the city known as Zone-A  to complete mandatory evacuations by Friday at 8 p.m. , along with homes for the aged and nursing homes. He urged homebound residents in the zone to use the city  s dial-a-ride system for the disabled to evacuate on Friday as well. When asked of those people who insisted to stay were the storm to worsen , Bloomberg said , They could die !  NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said the police will be prepared in the event of an evacuation. We will also assist if there is any evacuation , make sure that the routes are kept open to and to escort them if needed ,  he said. We will pre-position emergency services units and highway units at areas that historically and traditionally clog up , flood and back up of certain areas of the FDR Drive for instance that will perennially flood. We  ll help the best we can to expedite evacuation.  Also today , NJ Gov. Chris Christie also signed a state of emergency in advance of Hurricane Irene. The declaration cleared the way for the state to deploy resources  such as the National Guard  to counties and municipalities as they prepare for the storm. Do not try to ride it out. It is not the smart thing to do ,  Christie said during a news conference. He urged citizens not to travel to the popular Jersey Shore and said he was considering issuing a mandatory evacuation of the southern portion of the New Jersey coastline. I  m urging folks to voluntarily leave either tonight or tomorrow during the day ,  Christie said. Officials in Cape May County , N.J. , ordered a mandatory evacuation starting Friday at 8 am that will require as many as 750,000 people to leave the area , The Philadelphia Inquirer reported today. The last hurricane to slam the New York-area was in 1985 when Hurricane Gloria struck. During that storm , New York City only got three inches of rain , although many people were left without power. Hurricanes are rare in the Northeast because the region  s cooler seas tend to weaken storms as they approach , and they have to take a narrow track to strike New York without first hitting other parts of the coast and weakening there. Still , strong storms have been known to unleash serious damage in an urban environment already surrounded by water. A September 1821 hurricane raised tides by 13 feet in an hour and flooded all of Manhattan south of Canal Street  an area that now includes the nation  s financial capital. An infamous 1938 storm dubbed the Long Island Express came ashore about 75 miles east of the city and then hit New England , killing 700 people and leaving 63,000 homeless. The city has already seen the power of Mother Nature once this week , and Mother Nature may not be done with us yet ,  Bloomberg said of Hurricane Irene. Irene could hit North Carolina  s Outer Banks by Saturday morning. The storm is then predicted to chug up the East Coast , dumping rain from Virginia to New York City before a much-weakened form reaches land in Connecticut. Finally , it should peter out in Maine by Monday afternoon. A hurricane watch was put in place on Thursday for the North Carolina coast  covering the coastline north of Surf City to the state  s border with Virginia  as Irene bore down on the US. Approximately 200,000 people were ordered to evacuate from the Atlantic coast of North Carolina , with tourists barred from most of the beach towns of the Outer Banks ahead of the storm  s anticipated Saturday arrival , The Raleigh News &amp; Observer reported. The former chief of the National Hurricane Center called Irene  s projected path one of his three worst possible situations. One of my greatest nightmares was having a major hurricane go up the whole Northeast coast ,  Max Mayfield , the center  s retired director , told The Associated Press. He said the damage will probably climb into billions of dollars : This is going to have an impact on the United States economy.  The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said damages could exceed most previous storms because so many people live along the East Coast and property values are high. We  ve got a lot more people that are potentially in the path of this storm ,  FEMA Director Craig Fugate said in an interview with The Associated Press. This is one of the largest populations that will be impacted by one storm at one time.  The storm would have a lot of impact well away from the coastline ,  he added. A little bit of damage over big areas with large populations can add up fast.  Irene would be the first hurricane to reach landfall in the US since Hurricane Ike pounded the Gulf Coast in 2008. The Category 3 storm with winds of 115 mph  the threshold for a major hurricane  would be the strongest to strike the East Coast in seven years. As of 8 : 00 p.m. Thursday night , Irene was still barrelling towards the US , packing 115mph winds as it demolished homes and tore down power lines. Early Friday , the storm was once again in warm Atlantic waters that could energize it. Weather-wise New Yorkers weren  t taking any chances that Irene will blow out to sea. If you were a gambler , I think you could give odds that it  s going to be windy and rainy here , at least. It  s a big storm , even if it  s off shore ,  said Charlie Hurd , of the City Island Yacht Club in The Bronx. Club members got an e-mail yesterday asking them to check their moorings and reduce their boats  windage   that is , anything that might be blown around by strong gusts. Sustained winds of this strength will find any weakness  count on it ,  the e-mail said. City officials say they  re preparing for the worst , and are ready to evacuate as many as 75,000 people from areas prone to storm surges  massive ocean upswells , 5 to 7 feet high , that can flood low-lying land. Surge is perhaps the most damaging and most dangerous thing that can happen in a city that has low-lying areas ,  said Joseph Bruno , commissioner of the city  s Office of Emergency Management. The sense is that we  re going to be facing a strong tropical storm in New York City , which would bring winds from 40 to 50 to 60 miles per hour and could bring rain from 6 to 12 inches ,  he said. In Springfield Gardens , Queens , rain almost always brings flooding  and the advancing hurricane set residents scrambling to be ready. I  m stocked up on food and canned goods ,  said Allen Ortiz. He has built a cinderblock wall several inches high to keep his driveway from flooding , and set up two pumps to clear water out of his basement. And storm-savvy New Yorkers were also stocking up yesterday at the Home Depot in Ozone Park. Clifford Singh , who lives nearby , bought several flashlights. Singh is originally from the British Virgin Islands , where they know hurricanes. I  ve bought water , groceries , everything ,  he said. I always stock up.  The Bahamas government has discontinued the hurricane warning for the southeastern Bahamas. The warnings remain in place for the central and northeastern Bahamas. US Navy officials confirmed to Fox News Channel that vessels from the 2nd fleet based along the Virginia coastline were ordered out to sea Wednesday night in preparation for Irene  s expected landfall. The Miami-based NHC issued its watch for the North Carolina coast covering an area from north of Surf City to the North Carolina-Virginia border , including the areas around Pamlico , Albemarle and Currituck Sounds. A tropical storm watch was also issued from north of Edisto Beach in South Carolina to Surf City in North Carolina. The Category 3 hurricane was located about 65 miles east-north-east of Nassau in the Bahamas. The hurricane is expected to strengthen Thursday and into Friday. Life-threatening surf conditions and heavy swells are expected to strike the southeastern coast of the US later Thursday. While some people prepare , others are holding off hurricane-related decision-making. Organizers of the Dave Matthews Band concerts on Governors Island this weekend hadn  t decided yesterday whether to postpone or cancel. Officials of the Barclays golf tournament in Plainfield , NJ , expect it  ll be rained out this weekend , but as of yesterday they hadn  t officially decided to call off play. With AP"
93,"PORT-AU-PRINCE ( Reuters ) - The death toll from Haiti  s cholera epidemic has reached more than 900 and the disease is present in six of the 10 provinces of the earthquake-battered Caribbean country , the Health Ministry said on Sunday. An update on the ministry website ( www.mspp.gouv.ht ) said as of November 12 , there had been 917 deaths and more than 14,600 hospitalized cases since the outbreak began more than three weeks ago in the Western Hemisphere  s poorest state. The central rural province of Artibonite , the epicenter of the epidemic , remained the worst affected , accounting for nearly 600 of the total deaths. Other provinces affected were Center , Nord , Nord Ouest , Sud , and Ouest , where the capital Port-au-Prince is located. The capital , which bore the brunt of destruction from the January 12 earthquake in Haiti , has recorded 27 deaths up to November 12. The government and its aid partners are fighting to prevent the disease spreading in crowded city slums and tent camps housing over 1.3 million homeless earthquake survivors. The United Nations forecasts up to 200,000 Haitians could contract cholera as the outbreak extends across the country of nearly 10 million , and says $ 163.9 million in aid is needed over the next year to combat the epidemic.

94,"( This Feb. 1 story corrects date when the Nobel prize is awarded in 8th paragraph ) FILE PHOTO : White House adviser Jared Kushner , flanked by aide Avi Berkowitz ( L ) and Brian Hook , former U.S. envoy to Iran , during a press briefing on the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates at White House in Washington , U.S. , August 13 , 2020. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and his deputy , Avi Berkowitz , were nominated by a friendly attorney on Sunday for the Nobel Peace Prize for their role in negotiating four normalization deals between Israel and Arab nations known as the Abraham Accords.  The deals were announced in a four-month span between mid-August and mid-December and were the most significant diplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East in 25 years as the region girds for a prolonged confrontation with Iran. Nominating the pair of former deputies to then-President Donald Trump was American attorney Alan Dershowitz , who was eligible to do so in his capacity as a professor emeritus of Harvard Law School. Dershowitz had defended Trump in his first impeachment trial last year and said in a Jan. 20 comment in the Wall Street Journal that the Senate should dismiss the article of impeachment against Trump over the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol as he is no longer president. In his letter to the Nobel committee , Dershowitz also cited the work of former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and former Israeli ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer in the normalization deals. He seemed to suggest his nomination could be controversial. The Nobel Peace Prize is not for popularity. Nor is it an assessment of what the international community may think of those who helped bring about peace. It is an award for fulfilling the daunting criteria set out by Alfred Nobel in his will ,  he wrote. Kushner , who is Trump  s son-in-law , and Berkowitz , who was the Middle East envoy , were key figures in negotiating deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Sudan and Morocco. In a statement , Kushner said he was honored to be nominated for the prize. The winner will be announced in October and the award presented in December. President Joe Biden  s administration is expected to review all national security deals struck during the Trump administration , including arms packages for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Some lawmakers have complained about the Morocco deal because , to win the nation  s agreement , the United States recognized its sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara. Trump left office on Jan. 20 under a cloud of controversy , potentially affecting whether the two aides would be awarded the Nobel .|||||Alan Dershowitz has nominated Jared Kushner for a Nobel Peace Prize.

95,"It  s fact , not fantasy. In the last four years , at least 13 young men have inflicted tragedies after steeping their psyches in hate forums , websites and across social networking apps. Some have scythed into cultural consciousness. Millions know the name Dylann Storm Roof. But many millions more have never heard of neo-Nazi hate group Atomwaffen Division ( AWD ) and the Iron March forum  the online race-hate incubator where AWD met , recruited and congregated. Nevertheless , that forum and this group exemplify recent trends in the more youthful strains of online extremism and radicalization. Many eventual recruits appear to be joining online social networks before becoming members of an established hate group. And as organized hate groups recruit and centralize in relative obscurity online before ever manifesting irl  ( in real life  ) , the void of domestic efforts to counter radicalization grows as fast as young potential recruits move across the web and transition between apps. In less than a year , AWD has proven how young men , some in their teens and early 20s , can steepen the arc of their own radicalization when they gather together. The group has also attracted peers via slick , sophisticated digital propaganda , much of which directed traffic to Iron March ( IM ) before that forum was taken offline in the fall of 2017. Though it has been in existence since at least October 2015 , AWD is only now grabbing headlines , as five murders have been linked to either members , like Devon Arthurs , 18 ; alleged members , like Samuel Woodward , 20 ; or individuals , like Nicholas Giampa , 17 , who associated closely with the group online. Giampa stands accused of executing his girlfriend  s parents , Buckley Kuhn-Fricker , 43 , and Scott Fricker , 48. The pair intervened to remove Giampa from their daughter  s life when the depths of his support of violent race-hate became apparent. According to Huffington Post , his Twitter feed shows , a 17-year-old who  d drifted beyond the trolling of his teenage peers on the internet far-right and was fully in thrall to the racist , apocalyptic fantasia of white nationalism ... [ who ] tweeted about his hatred of transgender people and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. He tweeted about using Jews as target practice.  But what nurtured these young men  s propensity for violence ? In the case of AWD , much has been made of the group  s fetishizing of Charles Manson and their cherishing of an obscure neo-Nazi polemic called SIEGE , a work that stridently promotes terrorism. Behind such references stands James Mason , who produced SIEGE as a newsletter from 1980 until the summer of 1986. Mason  s presence in the organized neo-Nazi movement in this country stretches back to the mid-1960s , when he was just 14 years old. For AWD members , it  s not about Helter Skelter  or the gory details of the Manson Family murders alone. It  s about racial terrorism , The Family and its murders  and their broader cultural impact. Here Mason serves as a philosophical totem and provides a template for action. To miss the significance of Mason  s influence in the dark , sensational luster of Manson is to lose a vital recognition ; SIEGE and AWD are obsessed with a racial revolution , not a cultural one like Manson  s. AWD has only recently begun associating itself so synonymously with Mason and SIEGE , and that  s a dangerous development. Mason and his writings preach the praxis of leaderless , cell-structured terrorism and white revolution. Furthermore , there is a plethora of terrorists and fringe texts beyond Mason  s that motivate and inspire the group. Many of these texts are valued in other sectors of the far-right. Importantly , Mason achieved  much within neo-Nazism before he was out of his 20s : This is important for young men who , sometimes literally , are gathering around Mason and steeping themselves in his revolutionary philosophy and polemics. They , too , hope to achieve ,  but understanding what that means is equally challenging and vital. GTK ! RWN !  : Iron March begins T he Daily Stormer  s creator , Andrew Anglin , recently claimed that his target demographic includes children as young as 11. Certainly , without the aesthetic , slang and meme-laden milieu of the Daily Stormer , the IM forum would not have developed the way it did. The forum is an extension of , and reaction to , how neo-Nazi influencers built a contemporary movement online over the last several years. Launched in September 2011 and July 2013 respectively , IM and Daily Stormer did not develop as counterpoints , but as complements to one another. IM  s slogan , Gas the K ---- ! Race War Now ! 1488 ! Boots on the Ground !  was designed to inflame. The Iron March crest. IM became home base for those who were personally invested in neo-Nazism , fascism and organized white extremism on a global scale. There , they debated , debased and denigrated , sometimes even each other , and plotted securing a future for whites and their children   violently if necessary. There , the canonical works of global fascism evolved into active discussion threads : For My Legionaries/ Corneliu Z. Codreanu ,  The Doctrine Of Fascism/ Benito Mussolini ,  Excerpts From Speeches/ Jos Antonio Primo De Rivera.  One early thread was titled , Fascist Bookstores , Blogs , Resources.  The creator of the thread What is this Forum for? ,  put forth the following : This forum exists for discussing human psychology and two specific issues that are very relevant to our political interests : 1. Propaganda , manipulation and influence. Giving speeches , making allies and turning enemy against enemy. The art of psychological warfare. 2. Miscommunication , Confirmation Bias and other afflictions that stand in the way of progressing our interests and how to overcome them. Knowing your enemy in order to destroy him and knowing your ally in order not to offend him because you understand the same word as different things. Other topics that still relate to both psychology and politics will also be welcome. Another thread , American Futurism Workshop ,  was dedicated to the exploration of how best to inject the tenets of Italian Futurism  an important social and artistic movement that helped inspire the rise of fascism in Italy  into contemporary American society. The fact that much of the Futurism  thread has been reproduced on the SIEGE-Culture web site , one of AWDs new online hubs , evidences how the forum  s influence endures. IM was the incubator for U.S.-based hate groups like American Vanguard , formed in 2015 , which eventually birthed Vanguard America in 2017. James Fields , before he allegedly killed Heather Heyer and injured many others , held one of Vanguard America  s shields in Charlottesville , Virginia. The United Kingdom-based neo-Nazi National Action ( NA ) , whose youth-oriented aspirations and aesthetic helped inspire the founding of other groups internationally , including AWD and arguably Vanguard America , was also connected to IM. In December 2016 , around three years after NA  s formation , it became the first-ever neo-Nazi group outlawed as a terrorist organization by the U.K. government. That was five months before the first Atomwaffen-linked murders occurred. Beyond Anglin and Andrew Weev  Auernheimer  the hacker and dedicated neo-Nazi involved with Daily Stormer who encourages the mass-downloading of White Supremacy 2.0 into the minds of the young recruits  there are individuals like Charles Zeiger.  Zeiger  is the alias of a prolific writer at Daily Stormer and head editor of IM  s webzine , NOOSE , formerly hosted at ropeculture.org. Zeiger  s work was also featured on NA  s Wordpress blog. Amongst the aforementioned influencers and dozens of texts presented on IM , James Mason and his SIEGE found a new , young , niche audience , particularly among AWD members and sympathizers. After languishing in obscurity for decades , Mason has been rediscovered. By the time it was taken offline on September 24 , 2017 , 1,653 unique usernames had been registered on IM. The forum  s legacy demonstrates that for those who have moved on from the forum and are putting boots on the ground , memes are no longer their preferred ammunition  now , it  s bullets. Powered by Hate  : Building the SIEGE-Pill Mill On May 19 , 2017 , Devon Arthurs allegedly murdered two other members of Atomwaffen Division , Andrew Oneschuk , 18 , and Jeremy Himmelman , 22 , in the suburban Tampa , Florida , apartment they shared with the group  s leader , Brandon Russell , 21. Russell was recently convicted of charges related to explosive materials found on the premises , and Arthurs awaits trial. Since Russell  s imprisonment , AWD and James Mason have become nearly synonymous. The result is an even more terrorist-minded version of the group than what existed under Russell , a cadre that fetishizes violence as its core doctrine. In late June , barely a month after the Tampa murders , AWD launched a new website and YouTube page. In December much of the same content was uploaded to a Bitchute account  a peer-to-peer video service favored by individuals and organizations banned from conventional video hosting services. Under Russell , AWD had announced itself primarily via flyering and stickering college and university campuses at night , mostly between December 2015 and April 2017. However , a new phase of AWD is now underway. Only one flyering incident has occurred since May 19. That  s when their YouTube page shifted away from campus exploits to footage of tactical training with assault rifles and other weapons , urging viewers to step out from behind their computer screens and take action. On October 24 , 2017 , another new website was registered and hosted via Cloudflare : SIEGE-Culture ( S-C ) . With Russell in prison , AWD  s most influential member goes by the handle Rape  in online forums , and calls himself Vincent Snyder on the S-C site , Rape publishes under the pen name Vincent Snyder.  On its Staff  page , five of the eight individuals pictured evidence allegiance to , or membership in , AWD. Snyder  s photo appears next to Mason  s. Mason  s influence is evident on that site  s Worldview  page : What we are creating here is something that James Mason attempted to put into form but because of circumstance it never was implimented [ sic ] until the year of 2017 when Atomwaffen Division discovered and met James Mason. Ryan and Vincent Snyder both agreed to help him publish his works , but through the development of the website we have decided to take the proper course of action with SIEGE. Too long has the movement trapped people into a mindset of chasing their own tail. Those of you who are in here , perhaps , will create history. That is our intention.  The page  s banner features Mason and Charles Manson  s faces flanking either side of the Universal Order  s ( UO ) logo. UO is the terroristic neo-Nazi philosophy Mason launched in 1982 under the tutelage of Manson. As Mason describes in SIEGE and elsewhere , the ideas behind the Universal Order would not have been possible without his years of correspondence with Manson , who suggested the UO name and logo. James Mason , seated , with "" Vincent Snyder. "" Mason  s association with Manson , and his interpretation of Manson  s ideas , developed after Mason spent years in the organized neo-Nazi movement. During that time , he gravitated toward increasingly radical , terroristic-minded figureheads and efforts. Mason wrote in SIEGE that his correspondence with the imprisoned Manson could be construed as cheap , mere shock value. But as the 560-pages of Mason  s text suggest , Manson is not the skeleton key for understanding AtomWaffen. Mason  s own neo-Nazi influences and beliefs in chorus with the Universal Order philosophy offer a more accurate portrait. Mason began reconfiguring his own sustained belief in the need for neo-Nazi terror cells willing to strike at American culture under the control of Jewish influences , which he dubs the System.  Mason had already been moving toward that conclusion on his own for the better part of 15 years. During that time , Mason began networking. As an adolescent he idolized George Lincoln Rockwell , the leader of the American Nazi Party ( ANP ) , which he first tried to join at just 14. Through Rockwell , Mason also met William Pierce  the eventual founder of the National Alliance , author of The Turner Diaries and this country  s most influential neo-Nazi to date. Pierce also helped shepherd young Mason into the ANP. After Rockwell was murdered by a former Nazi Party member in August 1967 , Pierce and Mason joined its successor , the National Socialist White People  s Party ( NSWPP ) . There , Mason came into contact with another Pierce protg , Joseph Tommasi. Tommasi was still in his teens when Pierce convinced him to pilot a youth effort within the NSWPP , one that would flyer college campuses , fight with leftists and liberals and mount a foreboding challenge to the radical left on campus. Although Pierce soon left the NSWPP , disgusted by leader Matt Koehl  s propensity for costume-oriented activism and pageantry , Tommasi and Mason stayed on. Despite Tommasi  s youth , his profile and influence grew and Koehl began to view him as a potential rival for party leadership. Tommasi  s speeches and writing , ideas about propaganda and desire for street-level confrontation further influenced Mason. In SIEGE , he calls Tommasi  s 1974 leaflet , POLITICAL TERROR ,  a work of the most incredible genius.  In 1973 , Tommasi was ejected from the NSWPP. Convinced that mass movement-oriented neo-Nazism was useless , he founded the National Socialist Liberation Front ( NSLF ) in March 1974. The Front modeled its name ( taken from the Vietnamese Liberation Front ) , aesthetics , personality and doctrine on radical leftist groups , like the terrorist Weather Underground. The NSLF sought to announce itself above ground through its actions only , while existing otherwise as an underground , revolutionary terrorist cell , the first of its kind in American neo-Nazism. Mason eventually followed Tommasi out of the NSWPP , but Tommasi was murdered in August 1975 by an NSWPP party member standing guard at its headquarters in El Monte , California. After Mason started the SIEGE newsletter in 1980 , he was increasingly adopting Manson  s ideas and perfecting the ideas Tommasi first catalyzed. In the manner prescribed by Tommasi ,  he writes , Our most eloquent statements will not be made in courtrooms , but in the streets of Jew-Capitalist America.   He continues elsewhere in the text , underscoring that Tommasi ' s secret was that he essentially stopped talking and started doing. He said that all talk , all discussion , was counter-revolutionary. The situation has been talked to death and still they go on talking ! Tommasi also knew the real difference between useless effort and effective action practically applied.  Political propaganda. After making his first Manson-centered propaganda poster while piloting a one-man effort , the National Socialist Movement , Mason decided to reach out to the Manson Family. He first wrote to Family members Sandra Good and Lynette , after learning they were imprisoned in Alderson , West Virginia. With their endorsement , Mason eventually made contact with Manson himself. Through this correspondence , Mason was convinced he had discovered a supreme template for a white supremacist revolution. He described the Manson Family and their captivating exploits as a model for the white race  s survival. By 1982 , Mason fully embraces such ideas , introducing the Universal Order philosophy via the pages of SIEGE. Mason believed the Universal Order could encourage others to enact a Tommasi-esque program of terror with the level of notoriety that the Manson family achieved and enjoyed for decades. Only through such infamy could neo-Nazi terror cells accelerate the collapse of the System.  After that , Mason and his acolytes could institute a balance and order by instituting a version of National Socialism that eschews left/right political binaries. This would solidify the existence of the white race over its enemies. We don  t want to hurt  the System , we want to KILL IT [ sic ] ! ,  he writes. Thus , Mason installed Manson and the Manson Family into his canon of idols , alongside Rockwell , Tommasi and , to a lesser-but-important extent , William Pierce. Following after those Crazy Men of Destiny ,  Mason regarded Manson as the more current and up-to-date  version of Tommasi  s terrorist doctrine. Manson represents the great divide between those persons who imagine there are still are choices to be made casually on the basis of Establishment mores and those who have a profound , individual sense of no going back.  I believe it is this - and not the abstract idea of realism  - that is the great sustainer and inner-flame of all true revolutionaries.  Like Mason  s other idols , Manson represents equal parts philosopher and revolutionary , with an irrepressible desire for violent action. Mason recognized the Manson Family as a racial-socialist colony   a collective of like-minded individuals from the same race who coalesced for survival within and against a nation riddled with disorder. In Manson , Mason cultivates a totem for the revolutionary potential of the individual and the collective , where both disappear into one another. Throughout SIEGE , Mason is driven by an urgency rooted in one hope  if only National Socialists could come together like The Family and captivate the nation through action , which in practice means lone wolf racial terrorism. This is the danger that Atomwaffen Division poses , whether members act as individuals or as cells ; forget the shock value of Manson. Behind Mason is an entire canon of terrorist doctrine. Timothy McVeigh of Oklahoma City fame  : Distributing the SIEGE-Pill The SIEGE-Culture website presents a future for neo-Nazism through the lens of James Mason , in the hope that others will see the future the way he does. As Ryan Schuster , publisher of SIEGE  s second edition , writes in his introduction : SIEGE is to be used as a cookbook and guide. It is sincerely hoped this edition will prevail the vigilant( e ) [ sic ] intelligence to heed a clarion call , wage battles of attrition , and act in a manner commensurate to Timothy McVeigh of Oklahoma City fame. With its Library  page , S-C extends that guide through a trove of texts on racial terror. Many present ludicrous visions of the white race fighting epic battles against immense opposition. Texts from Vlkisch and Nazi esotericists , like Guido von List and Savitri Devi , sit alongside the Bhagavad Gita , valued for its predictions of the Kali Yuga , or the Age of Vice.  In online neo-Nazi circles , satanic texts are providing the most fodder for debate. Many are unsure and others angry about what Atomwaffen now represents. Two of the three texts in question are The Devil  s Notebook by Anton LaVey , founder of the Church of Satan , and Hostia : Secret Teachings of the Order of Nine Angles ( O9A ) , a three-volume collection of manuscripts penned by O9A members. They comprise codices of O9A  s beliefs and practices. Decades ago , the O9A allegedly came under the control of infamous British neo-Nazi David Myatt , who converted to radical Islam , but renounced his conversion eight years later and returned to esoteric spirituality. The group holds an important position in the niche , international nexus of occult , esoteric , and/or satanic neo-Nazi groups. The third book is Iron Gates , written by a member of the U.S.-based Tempel ov Blood , a sub-sect of O9A describing itself as a hybrid between a traditional satanic coven and a ( religious ) militant order.  The novel  s description on Amazon reads as follows : IRON GATES is a sci-fi horror / post-apocalyptic novel , detailing a bleak view of the spiritual horrors of the world-to-come. Set seventy years after a worldwide nuclear conflagration , IRON GATES allows the reader a sight into a nightmarish landscape populated by even more nightmarish characters in a hideous future which leaves little to the imagination. Brutal and unsparing , it is not suitable for readers under 18. Readers should be advised of extreme graphic content.  Atomwaffen member with Iron Gates graffiti. One Amazon reviewer writes , This is a great book. I ' m glad my good comrade Ryan wrote this book. Give it a read if you ' re into Rape [ sic ] stories and post-apocalyptic child stabing [ sic ] .  AWD  s turn to the occult and promotion of the hyper-sadistic is disturbing. Why would AWD push its members toward brutal , dehumanizing violence ? Though many in organized neo-Nazism are not convinced their turn toward the occult is sincere , others are reaching for their long knives. Some are accused of being Noctulains ,  O9A-devotees who claim to infiltrate fringe political groups , neo-Nazis among them , to reorient them toward satanism. Whether AWD is morphing or being infiltrated is unclear. AWD  s turn , though , resembles occult neo-Nazi groups before them , like the O9A , that meld religious and political extremism  two powerful conduits for violence. With such a turn , AWD is moving beyond the quotient of the culturally forbidden , of flyers broadcasting hate and offensive memes , and down a path toward tragedy. The future awaits   : The Torch is Passed Charles Manson holds a certain appeal to those who are attracted to such forbidden ideas. That  s particularly true for young people who revel in transgressing against society  s restrictions. It  s not surprising that Atomwaffen Division  under the stewardship of Mason  courts those who embrace cultural taboos beyond neo-Nazism to pinpoint new recruits. In a 1987 videotaped interview with AMOK Press , Mason characterized his fascination with the forbidden  as crucial to his own recruitment into neo-Nazism and acceptance of Manson  s influence : I won  t try to deny , especially in connection with the current Manson connection , that there was the element of the forbidden , or the rebellious , involved there , and to me at that time [ during his teen years ] Commander Rockwell and certainly the image of Adolf Hitler embodied the furthest extreme of that. And so that just pulled me in like a magnet.  In SIEGE , Mason makes clear his intention to recruit youth , and acknowledges Manson  s magnetic power in such a capacity : And YOUTH is the name to be applied to the group of people among whom you will find a majority of those who DEMAND RESULTS , not Right Wing bullshit. Manson explains that the older a person becomes , the more frozen they are in the programmed ways the System has inculcated them with. [ .... ] The most adept social and political movers of all times have known that , in order to have a successful movement , you must get ' em [ sic ] while they are YOUNG ! [ .... ] It is Youth that has the most to lose , that has traditionally been the most idealistic and action-minded. Charles Manson exerts a fascination over Youth today , in the en- tire West , more so by far than anyone else even remotely attuned to what we ' re trying to do.  He also noted that Young , wild , American , anti-Establishment  individuals might be more easily attracted to Manson than Hitler. Manson scares people ,  he writes , but he does so in the way they LIKE [ sic ] to be scared. There is no huge , vague , ugly thing  attached to Manson as there is to Hitler.  He writes similarly about Tommasi as an emblem , whose revolutionary praxis he describes as the very same thing as Adolf Hitler.  In Joseph Tommasi I see represented a number of things. All of the martyred comrades I can see in Tommasi. The young , especially , from the rank-and-file. In him I can still see the hope for the future arising out of the ashes and the dust of the former Movement for which he served as a soldier. He represents the clearness of mind and hardness of spirit to not only abandon the past for lost but to attack the present as the only means for achieving a future. And that future is entirely in the hands of those National Socialists serious enough to be called revolution.  AWD members are getting SIEGE-pilled through total immersion in Mason  s teleology. Now , they are challenging the established far-right and far-left with their eagerness to perpetrate violence. Accused killer Nicholas Giampa submerged himself in this dark pool. Whatever his other troubles , his exposure to AWD  s fetishizing of mass murder and promotion of racial terrorism should provoke grave concern. Since his journey in organized white supremacy began , Mason is , perhaps more than ever , seeing his ideas realized irl.  He has witnessed SIEGE-pilled young men push themselves to action through his designs. This new generation of men might remind Mason of his younger self. And they , in turn , are idolizing him , his writings and his actions with uncanny devotion  just as Mason himself idolizes Charles Manson. The logo for the Universal Order philosophy. Late in SIEGE , Mason expressed that , perhaps , he could push his philosophy of terroristic neo-Nazism no further : I have done what I could to inject - subtlely [ sic ] and overtly - as many of Manson ' s ideas into Movement thought as possible. I have had limited success. But having accomplished this much , I can only hope that the seeds have been planted and the torch passed  .  Among those who seeded Mason  s extremism , Rockwell and Tommasi were both killed by fellow white supremacists , years before Mason assumed lone control of the SIEGE newsletter. In the years since he ceased its publication and its first book edition was published , both William Pierce and Charles Manson have died. But Mason is alive. And with the inception of SIEGE-Culture and his collaboration with the young cell members that comprise Atomwaffen Division , his hands are on the torch along with theirs. An ouroboros wreaths the Universal Order  s logo ( above ) , which Manson helped Mason conceive and design. With AWD and Mason  s discovery of one another , the snake is no longer eating its tail. Its tail and head have virtually disappeared into one another .|||||The search for missing University of Pennsylvania sophomore Blaze Bernstein came to a grim end when the 19-year-old ' s body was found in a park near his parents ' home , having apparently been exposed by this week ' s rainstorms , police in California say. The Orange County Sheriff ' s Department has not disclosed a cause of death or the condition of the body , but they say the case is now a homicide investigation , the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The park , where a friend says he last saw Bernstein the night of Jan. 2 , is around a 10-minute walk from his parents ' home in Lake Forest.

Police say they believe Bernstein , who was in California for winter break , was killed the night he disappeared. story continues below "" Our family is devastated , "" father Gideon Bernstein said , per the AP , thanking the community for supporting the search effort. A high-school classmate told investigators that after they drove to Borrego Park on Jan. 2 , apparently to meet a third classmate , Bernstein walked into the park by himself and did not return. According to a search warrant affidavit seen by the OCRegister , when police spoke to the friend again on Jan. 4 , he was "" visibly shaking.

The news about the murder suspect , Samuel Woodward , spread quickly throughout the U.S. , and abroad. Woodward was accused of fatally stabbing 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein and burying his body in an Orange County park. Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter. The report , it turns out , was also taken up in the secretive online chats conducted by members of Atomwaffen Division , a white supremacist group that celebrates both Hitler and Charles Manson. I love this ,  one member wrote of the killing , according to copies of the online chats obtained by ProPublica. Another called Woodward a one man gay Jew wrecking crew.  More soon joined in. What I really want to know is who leaked that shit about Sam to the media ,  a third member wrote. At least one member wanted to punish the person who had revealed Woodward  s affiliation with Atomwaffen. Rats and traitors get the rope first.  Encrypted chat logs obtained by ProPublica  some 250,000 messages spanning more than six months  offer a rare window into Atomwaffen Division that goes well beyond what has surfaced elsewhere about a group whose members have been implicated in a string of violent crimes. Like many white supremacist organizations , Atomwaffen Division uses Discord , an online chat service designed for video gamers , to engage in its confidential online discussions. In a matter of months , people associated with the group , including Woodward , have been charged in five murders ; another group member pleaded guilty to possession of explosives after authorities uncovered a possible plot to blow up a nuclear facility near Miami. Lucas Waldron/ProPublica The group  s propaganda makes clear that Atomwaffen  the word means nuclear weapons  in German  embraces Third Reich ideology and preaches hatred of minorities , gays and Jews. Atomwaffen produces YouTube videos showing members firing weapons and has filmed members burning the U.S. Constitution and setting fire to the American flag. But the organization , by and large , cloaks its operations in secrecy and bars members from speaking to the media. The chat logs and other material obtained by ProPublica provide unusually extensive information about the group  s leaders , wider makeup , and potential targets , indicating : The group may have as many as 20 cells around the country , small groups of indeterminate size in Texas , Virginia , Washington , Nevada and elsewhere. Members armed with assault rifles and other guns have taken part in weapons training in various locations over the last two years , including last month in the Nevada desert near Death Valley. Members have discussed using explosives to cripple public water systems and destroy parts of the electrical power grid. One member even claimed to have obtained classified maps of the power grid in California. Throughout the chats , Atomwaffen members laud Timothy McVeigh , the former soldier who bombed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , killing 168 , including numerous children. Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof and Anders Breivik , the Norwegian extremist who massacred 77 people , also come in for praise. Woodward posted several messages in the days after Bernstein  s murder , but before he was arrested and charged. In one thread , he told his fellow Atomwaffen members that he was thinking about the passing of life  and was truly grateful for our time together.  An Atomwaffen propaganda flier Woodward , 20 , has pleaded not guilty in the Bernstein case. Prosecutors have said they are exploring whether the murder constituted a hate crime and detectives are now investigating what role , if any , Atomwaffen might have played in the homicide. Woodward and Bernstein had known each other in high school in California , and appear to have reconnected somehow shortly before the killing. Law enforcement , both federal and state , have said little about what they make of Atomwaffen. But organizations dedicated to tracking and studying hate groups have been calling attention to what they regard as the group  s considerable threat. We haven  t seen anything like Atomwaffen in quite a while ,  said Keegan Hankes , a researcher who tracks the group for the Southern Poverty Law Center. They should be taken seriously because they  re so extreme.  Jeffrey Kaplan , a historian , has studied racial extremists for decades and edited the Encyclopedia of White Power. In an interview , he suggested that Atomwaffen is dangerous , but that talk in their propaganda and private conversations of aims such as toppling the U.S. government amounted to what he called a kind of magical thinking.  Kaplan said such groups often contain a handful of diehards who are willing to commit crimes and many more wannabes who are unwilling to do much more than read fascist literature. It  s very hard to go from talking about violence to looking a guy in the eyes and killing him ,  said Kaplan , a professor of national security studies at King Fahd Defense College in Saudi Arabia. Where We  ve Identified Atomwaffen Division Members Through interviews and internal records , ProPublica was able to identify Atomwaffen members in at least 23 states. Lucas Waldron and Rob Weychert/ProPublica Politics are useless. Revolution is necessary.  ProPublica has identified five key Atomwaffen members through information provided by law enforcement investigators , internal Atomwaffen records , outside experts and a former group member. Those records and interviews make clear that John Cameron Denton is the leader of Atomwaffen. Denton , 24 , grew up in Montgomery , Texas , a small town about 30 miles north of Houston. Public records show Denton currently lives in the nearby town of Conroe , a few miles to the south of Montgomery. ProPublica has obtained several photos of Denton. In one , Denton , who is short and wiry , has a bulky combat shotgun slung over his shoulder. He seems to favor camouflage pants and black T-shirts emblazoned with the logos of National Socialist Black Metal bands , a fringe subgenre of heavy metal music that mixes Satanic and Nazi themes. Politics are useless. Revolution is necessary ,  Denton said in a chat post expressing the Atomwaffen worldview. Records and interviews show Denton goes by the name Rape in the online conversations , and he appears to be involved in nearly every aspect of the organization. He shapes Atomwaffen  s ideology , chooses designs for its distinctive black-and-white posters and online propaganda , and selects the books that new recruits must study as part of their initiation , said a former Atomwaffen member interviewed by ProPublica. Denton  s younger brother , Grayson Patrick Denton , 19 , is also a member , according to the chat logs and interviews ; within the group , he goes by Leon , an homage to a Belgian fascist who fought with the SS. John Cameron Denton Alias : Rape John Cameron Denton is the leader of Atomwaffen Division. The 24-year-old grew up in Montgomery , Texas , and lives outside Houston. The leader  s identity was first revealed last month in a report by the Anti-Defamation League. Afterward , Denton was seething. They think they can stop RAPE ! ? THEY THINK THEY CAN STOP ME ! ? ! ,  Denton wrote in one chat message. Neither Denton brother responded to messages seeking comment. Just how many people belong to Atomwaffen is unknown. The ex-member told ProPublica that the group has enlisted about 80 members across the country , many of whom joined after the deadly events in Charlottesville last summer. An internal Atomwaffen document obtained by ProPublica shows members scattered across 23 states and Canada. The group  s largest chapters are based in Virginia , Texas and Washington , according to a message posted in the chats by an Atomwaffen recruiter last summer. Each chapter operates independently ,  wrote the recruiter. We want men who are willing to be the boots on the ground. Joining us means serious dedication not only to the Atomwaffen Division and its members , but to the goal of Total Aryan Victory.  A review of the chat logs shows messages posted by people using more than 100 different user names. Access to the discussions is tightly controlled , and it is unclear if some members post under multiple usernames. Denton has helped build the organization around the ideas expressed in an obscure , hyper-violent book : Siege.  The 563-page book collects and organizes the monthly newsletters produced during the 1980s by an old-line neo-Nazi activist named James Mason. It is required reading for all Atomwaffen members and serves as the backbone for the organization  s ideology , worldview and training program. When Mason began publishing his newsletter in 1980 , he was bitter and deeply dismayed. He had devoted his life to the fascist cause , joining the American Nazi Party in the mid-1960s , at the age of 14. But the movement had completely failed. For Mason , the way forward was obvious : He no longer wanted to convince the masses of the rightness of Nazism. They would never get it. Now was the time for true believers to go underground and launch a clandestine guerrilla war aimed at bringing down The System.  Siege  is essentially a long string of essays celebrating murder and chaos in the name of white supremacy. In Mason  s view , Dan White , the local politician who assassinated San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and gay civil rights leader Harvey Milk , was a hero. Mason proposed the creation of a White Liberation Front composed of small armed squads that would hide in wilderness areas ,  moving frequently from location to location while striking out in a string of hit-and-run engagements.  Mason based this proposed organization on the short-lived National Socialist Liberation Front , a small splinter group of the American Nazi Party that formed in 1969 and espoused the strategic use of political terrorism. Grayson Patrick Denton Aliases : Nazgul , Leon Grayson Patrick Denton is the 19-year-old brother of Atomwaffen leader John Cameron Denton. He is a member of the Texas cell. The chat logs show that Denton and other Atomwaffen figures are in contact with Mason , who is 65 and is said to be living in Denver , Colorado ; in one online conversation , Samuel Woodward wrote about meeting with Mason face to face along with other Atomwaffen members. In chats , members frequently post pictures of Mason and revere him as a brilliant , under-appreciated thinker. ProPublica was unable to contact Mason. Jeffrey Kaplan , the academic at King Fahd Defense College in Riyadh , interviewed Mason in the 1990s and spoke to ProPublica about Mason  s outlook and the groups he inspires , such as Atomwaffen. He describes Mason as a true believer.  Now he  s got a following , which he didn  t have for the last 30 years ,  Kaplan said. He  s got some kids who  ve rediscovered him. He must be in heaven.  As Kaplan sees it , groups such as Atomwaffen  would-be Nazi guerrillas devoted to white revolution in the U.S.  are akin to cults ,  and are propelled by a quasi-religious faith that they will ultimately prevail. He continued , What else would sustain you when everyone hates you ?  John Cameron Denton , based on interviews and the material obtained by ProPublica , comes across as something of a cult leader. Lately he has been pushing for Atomwaffen members to pool money and purchase land in rural areas so they can get the fuck off the grid ,  and begin implementing their revolutionary agenda. The former member said Denton envisions using this network of Atomwaffen compounds to launch attacks against targets in the U.S. The leader is already girding for a confrontation with law enforcement. I do expect that one day I ' ll get raided ,  wrote Denton in one chat message. I ' m not gonna have a shoot out or anything stupid like that , but I just dont rule out possibilities because I know the govt doesnt play by the rules. "" You would want to target things like substations , water filtration plants , etc.  Late last month , Atomwaffen held a three-day training session  or Hate Camp  in the group  s parlance  deep in the Nevada desert. The event was organized by an Atomwaffen leader , Michael Lloyd Hubsky , who calls himself Komissar , according to the chat logs. Michael Lloyd Hubsky Alias : Komissar Hubsky , 29 , lives in Las Vegas and leads Atomwaffen  s Nevada cell. In online chats he discussed blowing up the U.S. power grid and natural gas lines. A 29-year-old resident of Las Vegas , Hubsky holds both a concealed weapons permit and a security guard license , and is a big fan of high-powered military-style firearms. In one post he discussed a favorite weapon : a Czech-made rifle called a CZ Scorpion that , Hubsky said , he  d converted to fully automatic and equipped with a flash suppressor. In another message , Hubsky wrote that he was planning on getting an FFL   federal firearms license  so he could manufacture  guns. I can literally become our armory in the event we need it ,  Hubsky bragged. The former member said Atomwaffen has a rule : Don  t talk about the group  s terrorist ambitions in online chats or on social media. Those sorts of conversations are only supposed to happen in person. But Hubsky , at times , has been less than discreet outside the group  s confidential chats. So in any war , you need to cut off your enemy  s ability to shoot , move and communicate ,  Hubsky wrote in a September 2017 message posted in a discussion on white nationalism that occurred in a non-Atomwaffen chat room. You would want to target things like : Substations , water filtration plants , etc.  ProPublica has obtained Hubsky  s statements from that online conversation. Hubsky wrote that he had a map of the US power grid.  West-coast only ,  he added in the message. Classified map. Had someone with special permissions get it.  John Cameron Denton , left , in an undated photograph with other white supremacists Hubsky also discussed blowing up natural gas lines. You put a home-made thermite grenade on those ,  he wrote. While other types of infrastructure  like water lines  figured in Hubsky  s discussions , hitting the power grid was , in his view , the most devastating and effective attack possible. Destroying electricity infrastructure , Hubsky wrote , would by default take out the internet because it relies on power to operate.  In a telephone conversation and subsequent series of text messages with ProPublica , Hubsky at first denied being a member of Atomwaffen. But he later offered to discuss the group at length if his name was not made public , an arrangement ProPublica declined. Hubsky acknowledged that he owns a CZ Scorpion assault rifle  even sharing a picture of the weapon  but said it was not fully automatic. He concluded the exchange by saying he had retained a lawyer. Hubsky  s organization of the three-day Hate Camp in Nevada began with a proposal to the group late last year. He offered to arrange it so the group could hone its combat skills. There would be shooting and hand-to-hand sparring at a secret location on the edge of Death Valley. Atomwaffen had already held a Hate Camp in the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois during the fall of 2017. At least 10 members from different states attended , with some driving in from as far away as Texas , Kansas , Oklahoma and New Jersey. In the Pacific Northwest , cell members had converged on an abandoned cement factory , known as Devil ' s Tower  near the small town of Concrete , Washington , where they had screamed gas the kikes , race war now !  while firing off round after round from any array of weapons , including an AR-15 assault rifle with a high capacity drum magazine. The training sessions were documented in Atomwaffen propaganda videos. Kaleb J. Cole Alias : Khimaere Atomwaffen  s Washington chapter leader is Kaleb J. Cole. Cole , who owns an AK-47 assault rifle with a large-capacity magazine , helped organize arms training sessions in Washington and Nevada. He also works on the group  s visual propaganda. Members had also organized smaller training sessions , such as the one last year in Texas that had drawn Blaze Bernstein  s alleged murderer , Samuel Woodward. The Texas training attended by Woodward took place in the countryside outside San Antonio and involved 10 members of the Texas cell who took part in firearms , survival and weapons instruction. Hubsky scheduled his training camp during the last weekend in January. Atomwaffen  s Washington chapter leader Kaleb J. Cole , who uses the alias Khimaere , agreed to help organize the desert training session in Nevada , which the group started calling the Death Valley Hate Camp. Bring your uniform , rifle/sidearm , and whatever camping gear you need ,  he wrote. Cole , who is 22 and lives close to the Canadian border in the town of Blaine , is a National Socialist Black Metal enthusiast who holds a concealed firearms permit and owns an AK-47. In 2015 , while Cole was living in Bellingham , police responded to a report that he had Nazi memorabilia  in his residence , according to Lt. Danette Beckley of the Bellingham Police Department ; he was also reported to police in the island town of Anacortes for allegedly harassing a Jewish grocery store owner by a waving a Nazi flag in front of the business , according to two law enforcement sources. The former Atomwaffen member told ProPublica that Cole wields a significant degree of influence over the organization  s propaganda , recruitment and organization. ProPublica could not reach Cole for comment. When the group got out to the desert , Hubsky made sure they shot photos and videos to be used in Atomwaffen recruiting clips. In one picture obtained by ProPublica , an Atomwaffen member is standing at the base of a sand dune showing off a military-grade weapon  an MCX Virtus rifle made by Sig Sauer  while holding a flag bearing the Atomwaffen insignia , a black shield bearing the symbol for radioactivity. Another member , clutching an assault rifle , is also in the photo. Hubsky returned from Death Valley enthused and eager to do more training. He uploaded a memo to the Atomwaffen chat. Members would now be required to join Front Sight , a private combat training facility  outside of Las Vegas in the small desert town of Pahrump. Front Sight , the memo said , could provide classes in Uzi and full auto M16 combat , as well as knife fighting , hand to hand combat ,  and instruction in climbing and rappelling. I don ' t know anything about this group ,  Bill Cookston , Front Sight  s director of operations , said this week. If anyone were to be doing something against the law or in a radical manner , we would look into that.  Shortly afterward , Michael Meacher , Front Sight  s CEO , said the training center had sent Hubsky a letter refunding his membership fees and informing the Las Vegas resident that he was banned from the facility for life. Not that the faggot kike didn  t deserve to die.  Before Samuel Woodward was jailed on charges of murdering Blaze Bernstein , he frequently participated in the Atomwaffen chats. First he used the handle Saboteur. Later he posted under the name Arn. Often , Woodward sounded like a typical 20-year-old. He enthused about video games ( BioShock , Skyrim ) and TV shows ( he liked the early seasons of Trailer Park Boys ,  a Canadian comedy series ) . He complained about not having a girlfriend. Read More About Woodward California Murder Suspect Said to Have Trained With Extremist Hate Group The 20-year-old man charged in Orange County with killing a gay Jewish college student earlier this month is said to have belonged to Atomwaffen Division , a neo-Nazi group. But Woodward also railed at mongrels and jews  and gays. He praised Mein Kampf and seemed to regard Siege  as something akin to divine revelation ; from his perspective , violence and society-shaking mayhem were the only options for a true Nazi. That orientation attracted him to outlaw groups like the National Socialist Underground , a German organization that carried out a massive terror spree between 2001 and 2011 , robbing 14 banks , planting bombs and murdering 10 people , most of them immigrants. The NSU was pretty cool ,  Woodward wrote. In one conversation , Woodward discussed the Bosnian Civil War of the 1990s , during which Serbian soldiers and paramilitary fighters raped thousands of Bosnian Muslim women as part of an infamous campaign of ethnic cleansing. The only acceptable case of miscegenation is what the serbs did to captured bosniak women ,  he wrote in November 2017. Woodward liked the idea of using rape to terrorize women of color , whom he saw as his foes. Force them to carry around the spawn of their master and enemy ,  he wrote. ProPublica sought comment on the chats from Woodward  s lawyer , Edward Munoz , but did not get a response. On Jan. 26 , ProPublica published a story revealing Woodward  s belief in Nazism and exposing his involvement with Atomwaffen. While the article attracted the attention of Atomwaffen members , who promptly posted it to their online chats , no one in the group expressed any sympathy for Bernstein , the young man Woodward allegedly murdered. They made jokes about his slaying and used slurs to describe him. If there was worry , it was about Woodward possibly having to do time behind bars for the murder. Sam did something stupid ,  wrote one member. Not that the faggot kike didn  t deserve to die. Just simply not worth a life in prison for.  Sean Michael Fernandez , an Atomwaffen leader in Texas , even saw an upside for the group. Fernandez , who used the alias Wehrwolf , believed that Atomwaffen actually stood to benefit from the increased notoriety stemming from Woodward  s affiliation with the neo-Nazi group and the Bernstein murder. We  re only going to inspire more copycat crimes  in the name of AWD. All we have to do is spread our image and our propaganda ,  Fernandez wrote on Jan. 30. Sean Michael Fernandez Alias : Wehrwolf Sean Michael Fernandez is a leader of the Texas cell. He continued : The growing fear is what we set out to do and it  s working EXACTLY how I wanted it to since we took over leadership.  I couldn ' t have planned this better , seriously.  For his part , Denton , the national Atomwaffen leader , felt betrayed. ProPublica had interviewed a former member for the story ; still , Denton believed that someone currently within the ranks was sharing information with the media. Looks like AWD needs another purging ,  he wrote. Members began speculating about who was talking to outsiders. Was it a current member ? Was it someone they  d kicked out recently ? Members also directed their rage toward the media. As they saw it , Woodward was the one being victimized. Now that his involvement with Atomwaffen had spilled out into the public sphere , Orange County prosecutors might hit him with hate crimes charges  charges that could potentially add years to a prison sentence. We really owe those jews at ProPublica ,  wrote one member. Woodward posted many hundreds of messages to the Atomwaffen chats. But on Jan. 5 , he typed out a few lines that are quite distinct from all the rest. In them , the raging young man suddenly became highly sentimental. Two days earlier , according to prosecutors , he had buried Bernstein  s lifeless body in a park in Lake Forest , California. Now Woodward explained that he was reflecting on mortality. hey everyone ,  he wrote. i just wanted to let you all know i love you so much . |||||Series : Documenting Hate Tracking Hate Crimes and Bias Incidents The California man accused of killing a 19-year-old University of Pennsylvania student earlier this month is an avowed neo-Nazi and a member of one of the most notorious extremist groups in the country , according to three people with knowledge of the man  s recent activities. The man , Samuel Woodward , has been charged in Orange County , California , with murdering Blaze Bernstein , who went missing in early January while visiting his family over winter break. Prosecutors allege that Woodward stabbed Bernstein more than 20 times before burying his body in an Orange County park where it was eventually discovered. The two men had attended high school together. Woodward , 20 , is set to be arraigned on Feb. 2 and has not yet entered a plea. Orange County prosecutors say they are examining the possibility that the killing was a hate crime  Bernstein was Jewish and openly gay  and some recent news reports have suggested that the alleged killer might hold far-right or even white supremacist political beliefs. Now , three people with detailed knowledge of Woodward  s recent past have been able to shed more light on the young man  s extremist activities. They said Woodward was a member of the Atomwaffen Division , an armed Fascist group with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the U.S. government through the use of terrorism and guerrilla warfare. The Daily Digest Get the latest news from ProPublica every afternoon. The organization , which celebrates Hitler and Charles Manson , has been tied to four other murders and an elaborate bomb plot over the past eight months. Experts who study right-wing extremist movements believe Atomwaffen  s commitment to violence has made it one of the more dangerous groups to emerge from the new wave of white supremacists. Two of the three people who described Woodward  s affiliations are friends of his ; the other is a former member of Atomwaffen Division. ProPublica  s revelations about Woodward  s background add a new element to a murder case that has attracted considerable local and national news coverage. But they also raise fresh concerns about groups like Atomwaffen Division , shadowy outfits of uncertain size that appear capable of genuine harm. Woodward joined the organization in early 2016 and later traveled to Texas to attend Atomwaffen meetings and a three-day training camp , which involved instruction in firearms , hand-to-hand combat , camping and survival skills , the former member said. ProPublica has obtained photographs of Woodward at an outdoor Atomwaffen meeting in the scrubby Texas countryside. One of the photos depicts Woodward and other members making straight-armed Nazi salutes while wearing skull masks. In other pictures , Woodward is unmasked and easily identifiable. The young man is proficient with both handguns and assault rifles , according to one person who participated in the Texas training and watched him shoot. That person also said that Woodward helped organize a number of Atomwaffen members in California. Social media posts and chat logs shared by Woodward  s friends show that he openly described himself as a National Socialist  or Nazi. He was as anti-Semitic as you can get ,  according to one acquaintance. ProPublica contacted Orange County prosecutors regarding Woodward  s alleged neo-Nazi activities. Michelle Van Der Linden , a spokesperson for the District Attorney  s Office , said she couldn  t comment directly on the case , but said the investigation is ongoing , with detectives exploring all possible leads. Woodward told police Bernstein had tried to kiss him while they were in the park , according to a sealed affidavit obtained by the Orange County Register. Woodward  s defense lawyer , Edward Munoz , did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday , Bernstein  s parents spoke to reporters about the loss of their son , but said they were not interested in talking about any information they had on the investigation of his death. Read More Police Stood By As Mayhem Mounted in Charlottesville State police and National Guardsmen watched passively for hours as self-proclaimed Nazis engaged in street battles with counter-protesters. ProPublica reporter A.C. Thompson was on the scene and reports that the authorities turned the streets of the city over to groups of militiamen armed with assault rifles. The Los Angeles Times quoted his mother , Jeanne Pepper Bernstein , as saying she had worried during her son  s life that he might be a target  because he was small , and Jewish , and gay. I was concerned sending him out into the big world ,  she said. But at some point you have to let go and they leave the nest and fly. I couldn  t protect him from everything.  Atomwaffen started in 2015 and is estimated to have about 80 members scattered around the country in small cells ; the former member said the group  s ranks have grown since the lethal and chaotic Unite the Right  rally last summer in Charlottesville , Virginia. While many of the new white extremist groups have consciously avoided using Nazi imagery , Atomwaffen has done the opposite. The name can mean Atomic Weapons  in German , and the organization embraces Third Reich iconography , including swastikas , the Totenkopf , or death  s head insignia , and SS lightning bolts. The group frequently produces YouTube videos featuring masked Atomwaffen members hiking through the backcountry and firing weapons. They  ve also filmed themselves burning the U.S. Constitution and setting fire to the American flag at an Atomwaffen Doomsday Hatecamp.  Atomwaffen  s biggest inspiration seems to be James Mason , a long-time fascist who belonged to the American Nazi Party and later , during the 1970s , joined a more militant offshoot. During the 1980s , Mason published a newsletter called SIEGE , in which he eschewed political activism in favor of creating a new fascist regime through murder , small lone wolf  terror attacks , and all-out war against the government. Mason also struck up a friendship with the late Charles Manson , who has become another hero for Atomwaffen. The organization first gained a measure of national attention in May of last year , when 18-year-old Devon Arthurs , one of Atomwaffen  s founding members , was charged in state court in Tampa , Florida , with murdering two of his roommates , Andrew Oneschuk , 18 , and Jeremy Himmelman , 22. Both victims were Atomwaffen loyalists. The murders allegedly occurred after Arthurs traded Nazism for radical Islam. When police took Arthurs into custody , according to news accounts based on police reports , he claimed he had shot his former comrades because they had taunted him about his Muslim faith and plotted violent attacks to further their fascist agenda. Arthurs told investigators he killed Onsechuk and Himmelman because they want to build a Fourth Reich.  While Arthurs initially confessed to the killings , he has pleaded not guilty and the case is ongoing. In early January , a judge ordered a psychiatrist to determine whether Arthurs is mentally competent to stand trial. When law enforcement searched the apartment in Tampa , Florida , where Arthurs and the others lived , they found firearms , a framed photograph of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , rifles , ammunition , and a cooler full of a highly volatile explosive called HMTD. Investigators also discovered radioactive material in the home. The bomb-making material belonged to a fourth roommate , Atomwaffen leader Brandon Russell , a Florida National Guardsman. Arthurs told authorities that Russell had been planning to blow up a nuclear power plant near Miami. Earlier this month Russell pleaded guilty in federal district court in Tampa to illegal possession of explosives and was sentenced to five years in federal prison. Atomwaffen surfaced again in connection with a double homicide in Reston , Virginia , in December 2017. A 17-year-old neo-Nazi allegedly shot to death his girlfriend  s parents , Buckley Kuhn-Fricker and Scott Fricker , who had urged their daughter to break up with him. The accused , who shot himself as well but survived and remains hospitalized , was charged as a juvenile in state court in Virginia with two counts of homicide. The 17-year-old was a big fan of Atomwaffen and James Mason , according to reporting by the Huffington Post , which examined his social media trail. The former Atomwaffen member in contact with ProPublica said that the teen was more than a fan : He was in direct communication with the group. Their rhetoric is some of the most extreme we have seen ,  said Joanna Mendelson , a senior researcher at the Anti-Defamation League  s Center on Extremism. The group , she said , views itself as the radical vanguard of the white supremacist movement , the frontline soldiers of an imminent race war ."
96,"WASHINGTON  The impacts of climate change driven by human activity are spreading through the United States faster than had been predicted , increasingly threatening infrastructure , water supplies , crops and shorelines , according to a federal advisory committee. The draft Third National Climate Assessment , issued every four years , delivers a bracing picture of environmental changes and natural disasters that mounting scientific evidence indicates is fostered by climate change : heavier rains in the Northeast , Midwest and Plains that have overwhelmed storm drains and led to flooding and erosion ; sea level rise that has battered coastal communities ; drought that has turned much of the West into a tinderbox. Advertisement Climate change , once considered an issue for a distant future , has moved firmly into the present ,  the report says. Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter , and periods of extreme heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer.  Written by 240 scientists , business leaders and other experts , the draft assessment arrives days after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its annual State of the Climate Report , which noted that 2012 was the hottest year on record. Together , the two major reports and a year of drought , wildfires , floods and freak storms have created for President Obama the chance to take substantial steps on climate change , environmentalists said. The report explicitly addresses the most controversial question in the global warming issue , saying that consumption of fossil fuels by humans is the main driver of climate change. The findings in the report are a three-alarm fire ,  said Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D-Beverly Hills ) . Climate change is already causing widespread disruption across the nation. We are in deep trouble if we don  t act forcefully this year.  But with the White House working on so many economic , foreign and domestic policy fronts , it remains unclear if the president will speak up more on climate , let alone spearhead new initiatives. The Obama administration has implemented several regulations to curtail emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that scientists say have stoked global warming. But the president seldom speaks of climate change. The White House declined to comment on the National Climate Assessment report , saying it had not had a chance to review it. The report , issued by an independent , interagency group operating under the president  s National Science and Technology Council , first came out in 2000 but went on hiatus during the Bush administration. It does not offer policy proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to help specific communities adapt to climate change. Instead , it details the risks they face. The Southwest , including California , produces more than half of the country  s high-value specialty  crops that are heavily dependent on irrigation. But a projected decline in snowpack and stream flow and increased competition for the water could threaten California  s agricultural communities. Higher temperatures could disrupt regional electricity grids and create public health emergencies in Southwestern cities , where 90 % of the region  s population lives. Flooding and sea level rise are already damaging some coastal California communities during storms and high tides , the assessment says , and water would come farther inland as erosion worsens. The final assessment will be issued in early 2014. Public comment on the draft will be accepted until April 12. neela.banerjee@latimes.com|||||The U.S. Global Change Research Program has released the Third National Climate Assessment. A 60-person Federal Advisory Committee ( The "" National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee "" or NCADAC ) oversaw the development of the draft climate report. The NCADAC , whose members are available here ( and listed in the report ) , was established under the Department of Commerce in December 2010 and is supported through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . It is a federal advisory committee established as per the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. The Committee serves to oversee the activities of the National Climate Assessment. Its members are diverse in background , expertise , geography and sector. A formal record of the committee can be found at the NOAA NCADAC website. A list of the committee  s decisions and actions is available on our NCADAC info page. The NCADAC engaged more than 250 authors in the creation of the report. The authors are acknowledged at the beginning of the chapters they co-authored. A draft report was released in January 2013 for a 90-day public comment period. Over 4,000 public comments were received and addressed by the authors. A panel of the National Academies also reviewed the draft report and published its consensus report. The report was revised by the authors in response to the public comments and National Academies review. NCADAC then submitted the Government Review Draft and the derivative Highlights document for formal interagency review. Final versions of the Third NCA and Highlights were adopted by NCADAC on May 6 , 2014 , and submitted to the Federal government. The Public Review Draft , Government Review Draft , and NCADAC-approved Final Report can be found below.

The third National Climate Assessment , released Friday , said there  s unambiguous evidence  that earth is warming , and that climate change over the past 50 years is driven primarily by human activity , especially from burning fossil fuels. Certain types of weather events have become more frequent and/or intense , including heat waves , heavy downpours , and , in some regions , floods and droughts. Sea level is rising , oceans are becoming more acidic , and glaciers and arctic sea ice are melting ,  states the draft report developed by a federal advisory panel. These changes are part of the pattern of global climate change , which is primarily driven by human activity ,  adds the draft report , released through U.S. Global Change Research Program. ADVERTISEMENT The report tallies the wide-ranging effects of climate change , such as water supplies stressed by declining runoff and increased risk of heat stress and waterborne disease , and notes that U.S. infrastructure is already being harmed by sea-level rise , storm surges and heavy downpours. It also tallies regional effects of climate change in the U.S. Environmentalists quickly seized on the report , which follows a separate federal announcement that 2012 was the hottest year on record in the lower 48 states , to call for more aggressive steps to drive down emissions. This could help restart a national conversation about climate change ,  said Todd Sanford , a scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. It gives us a road map for climate change. And the road is much bumpier if we continue along a higher emissions pathway.  Carol Browner , President Obama  s former climate czar , said the U.S. has made progress in reducing emissions but more action is needed immediately. We can start with strict carbon pollution standards for power plants and we must significantly expand investments in community resiliency to protect people and the economy from the gathering storms  and floods , droughts , wildfires , and heat waves ,  said Browner , who is now a senior fellow with the liberal Center for American Progress. The report finds that U.S. temperatures will continue rising 2 degrees F to 4 degrees F in most areas in the coming decades , and calls for effort to increase resilience to changes that cannot be avoided. But it  s unclear how high temperatures will climb. The report provides a range of 3 degrees F to 5 degrees F by century ' s end if global emissions are reduced sharply after 2050 , and up to 10 degrees F if they  re not. Average U.S. temperatures have risen roughly 1.5 degrees F since 1895 , and more than 80 percent of that increase has occurred since 1980 , the report concludes. The report is just the latest broad study or statement by a scientific body to conclude there  s overwhelming evidence that global warming is under way and that human activities are a major cause. For instance , the National Research Council , in a 2011 report , noted that climate change is very likely caused primarily  by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. However , a substantial number of Republicans dispute the conclusion that human activities are the primary driver of climate change. Rep. Lamar Smith ( R-Texas ) , chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee , said in a statement Friday that he plans to vet climate science in the new Congress. I believe climate change is due to a combination of factors , including natural cycles , sun spots , and human activity. But scientists still don  t know for certain how much each of these factors contributes to the overall climate change that the Earth is experiencing ,  he said in a statement Friday. It is the role of the Science Committee to create a forum for discussion so Congress and the American people can hear from experts and draw reasoned conclusions ,  he said. The panel will have a hearing on the environment in coming weeks , according to committee aides. While climate advocates are pouncing on the report , it  s unlikely to fundamentally change the politics of climate change on Capitol Hill , where bills to cap emissions or impose carbon taxes are moribund. However , green activists are pressing for stronger executive actions , such as Environmental Protection Agency carbon emissions standards for existing power plants. The broad new federal assessment was released in draft form Friday by the National Climate Assessment and Development and Advisory Committee , which is comprised of experts from academia , various industries and elsewhere. The National Research Council will review the draft , which is also open for public comment. The report was crafted under the Global Change Research Act of 1990 , which requires wide-ranging climate reports to the president and Congress.

97,"A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday , the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the US territory in recent days and caused heavy damage in some areas. A tsunami alert was issued for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico ' s Electric Power Authority also reported an island-wide power outage. The US Geological Survey said the quake hit just south of the island at a shallow depth of 6.2 miles. It initially gave the magnitude as 6.6 but later adjusted it. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage but the power outage made it hard to obtain information , the AP reports. A 5.8-magnitude quake that struck early Monday morning collapsed five homes in the southwest coastal town of Guanica and heavily damaged dozens of others. It also caused small landslides and power outages. ( Read more Puerto Rico stories. )|||||GUNICA , P.R.  Nearly two months after an earthquake sent the population of southwest Puerto Rico rushing into the streets , thousands of people are still slumbering each night under camping tents , on cots , in their cars and in enormous open tents that serve as government shelters. Long after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake sent powerful shock waves across the island on Jan. 7 , the ground continues to shake. Over the past week , 43 earthquakes classified as significant  have struck , according to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network , part of a prolonged and terrifying series of seismic events not seen on the island since 1918. A house in the town of Gunica recently collapsed after a fresh 3.8 magnitude temblor. And while most of the recent aftershocks have been relatively mild  only five over the past week exceeded 3.5 in magnitude  the cumulative damage and constant rattling have left many Puerto Ricans with their confidence deeply shaken. Hundreds of families are unable to pay for repairs to their ravaged homes. Others are unwilling to trust government inspectors  assurances that their houses are safe .|||||Since a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico Tuesday morning , residents in the southern municipality of Gunica have been without power and in some cases have resorted to sleeping outside , according to reports. Gunica and the surrounding areas have been rocked by multiple earthquakes since late last month. Fearing more building collapses , some homeowners have created overnight encampments on the side of highways , one county official says. Residents have also reported to the Associated Press that access to power and water are scarce. The people are afraid to enter their homes ,  said Gunica Mayor Santos Seda. The emotional health of our town , as I said from moment zero that occurred on December 28 , is what concerns me the most because of the immediacy of the emergency. How we are living is horrible.  Seda added that there are more than 174 homes in the town , and approximately 50 have completely collapsed , with the rest being cracked and on the brink of collapsing. He also notes that Gunica has lost businesses , and government buildings are in fragile conditions because of the frequent tremors. Psychologists have not only been making rounds throughout the community urging people to shake their fears , ' but also expressing uncertainty about the continuation of the quakes and aftershocks. Both Gov. Wanda Vsquez and President Trump have declared a state of emergency in Puerto Rico. Vsquez has already allocated $ 130 million to disaster relief efforts and is in communication with the Federal Emergency Management Agency ."
98,"It  s hard to believe now , but before Donald Trump became the G.O.P.  s presidential nominee in 2016 , Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was widely seen as a champion of the reformicons   conservatives who wanted the Republican Party to become more moderate and flexible , to move beyond its obsessive focus on cutting taxes for the rich and slashing benefits for the poor. Since then , however , Rubio has become a pathetic figure  not just a Trump toady , but someone who routinely tweets out stuff like this : The $ 3.5 trillion Biden plan isn  t socialism , it  s Marxism.  Indeed , we all remember the stirring passage in The Communist Manifesto where Marx declared , Workers of the world , unite to spend 1.2 percent of G.D.P. on popular programs over the next decade !  The fact that Republicans routinely say such nonsense is why the Biden administration should mint a $ 1 trillion platinum coin or declare that the Constitution gives it the right to issue whatever debt is needed to fund the government  or use some other trick I haven  t thought of to ignore the looming crisis. Some background : We all learned in civics class  do students still take civics ?  that federal policy on spending and taxing is set by a straightforward legislative process. Congress passes bills and if the president doesn  t veto those bills , they become law. End of story .|||||To get around Republican obstruction , President Biden said Tuesday that Democrats are considering a change to the Senate ' s filibuster rules in order to quickly approve lifting the nation ' s debt limit and avoid what would be a devastating credit default. "" It  s a real possibility , "" Biden told reporters. The president ' s surprise remarks come as the Senate is tangled in a fiscally dangerous standoff over a vote that ' s needed to suspend the nation ' s debt limit and allow the federal government to continue borrowing to pay down its balances , the AP reports. Congress has just days to act before the Oct. 18 deadline when the Treasury Department has warned it will run short of funds to pay the nation  s already accrued debt load. story continues below Biden has held off on any filibuster rule changes before over other issues , but his off-the-cuff comments Tuesday night interjected a new urgency to an increasingly uncertain situation. Getting rid of the filibuster rule would lower the typical 60-vote threshold for passage to 50. In the split 50-50 Senate , Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie , allowing Democrats to push past Republicans. The topic was broached during a private Democratic Senate lunch session Tuesday as senators were growing exasperated with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell ' s refusal to allow a simple vote on the debt limit. With Republicans putting up hurdles to the vote , Democratic senators have been discussing a range of options  including a carve-out to the chamber  s filibuster rules. But all Democratic senators would need to be on board to make the change , and at least one , West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin , sounded resistant. He and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema have raised objections to ending the filibuster on other topics this year.

It would be the token of all tokens : a $ 1 trillion coin , minted by the U.S. government , then cashed in to flood the treasury with cash and ... ( Associated Press ) WASHINGTON ( AP )  Some politicians think they ' ve found a silver bullet for the impasse over the debt limit , except the bullet is made of platinum : Mint a $ 1 trillion coin , token of all tokens , and use it to flood the treasury with cash and drive Republicans crazy. Even its serious proponents  who are not that many  call it a gimmick. They say it is an oddball way out of an oddball accounting problem that will have severe consequences to average people ' s pocketbooks and the economy if it is not worked out in coming days. But despite all the jokes about who should go on the face of the coin  Chuck E. Cheese ? Donald Trump , to tempt or taunt the GOP ?  there ' s scholarship behind it , too. However improbable , it is conceivable the government could turn $ 1 trillion into a coin of the realm without lawmakers having a say. How is this possible when the treasury secretary can ' t simply print money to pay public debts ? It ' s because a quirky law from more than 20 years ago seems to allow the administration to mint coins of any denomination without congressional approval as long as they ' re platinum. The intent was to help with the production of commemorative coins for collectors , not to create a nuclear option in a fiscal crisis. Oops. Specifically , the law says the treasury secretary may mint and issue platinum bullion coins and proof platinum coins in accordance with such specifications , designs , varieties , quantities , denominations , and inscriptions as the Secretary , in the Secretary  s discretion , may prescribe from time to time.  This is that time , in the view of coin advocates. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen , the White House and some Democrats slapped down the idea Tuesday , just as past leaders have done when the going got tough and radical quick-fixes emerged. The only thing kookier would be a politically inflicted default , "" Sen. Mark Warner , D-Va , said of the coin. Said Yellen , What  s necessary is for Congress to show that the world can count on America paying its debt. "" A platinum coin , she told CNBC , is really a gimmick. "" Sure it is , said Rohan Grey , a Willamette University law professor and expert on fiscal policy. The fact that ( the coin ) represents an accounting gimmick is a source of its strength , rather than a weakness ,  Grey wrote in a 2020-21 study in the Kentucky Law Journal. The idea of fighting an accounting problem with an accounting solution  is entirely coherent ... the debt ceiling itself can be viewed as one big , poorly designed accounting gimmick. "" The United States will hit the ceiling Oct. 18 unless Congress acts in time to suspend it. The two parties are in a stalemate in the Senate  Republicans unwilling to join Democrats in what used to be a routine exercise ; Democrats holding back on using only their own votes to fix the problem. That ' s what makes a shiny coin with a 1 and 12 zeroes tempting to some , if that untested and audacious path actually would work. But fraught questions arise for lots of Democrats as well as Republicans : Would they have wanted President Donald Trump to be ordering up mega-coins like Diet Cokes to his desk ? Do they want the next president to have that power ? Or even this one ? Other extraordinary possibilities have been floated , too , such as invoking the 14th Amendment ' s guarantee that the validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law ... shall not be questioned , "" which some scholars argue could be used to override the debt limit. The White House has looked at all such options and none of those options were viable , "" press secretary Jen Psaki said. So , we know that the only path forward here is through Congress acting.  The debt ceiling was instituted in the World War I era to make it easier for the U.S. to issue war bonds without needing congressional approval each time. Legislators only needed to stay under the approved total. Raising or suspending the ceiling has been a mostly uncontroversial task until recent times , because the debt comes mostly from spending that has already been approved by Congress or covers payments mandated by law. Now everything is fodder for a fight to the last minute. The Treasury can  t introduce new currency into circulation , only the Fed can do that. In theory , the coin would be minted and deposited with the Fed and its value would make its way into Treasury  s general account and used to pay a whole lot of bills. In practice , no one knows precisely how it would work and what problems , like inflation , would result. Democrats do not seem willing to upend a messy process that for generations has nevertheless stood as the gold standard in global credit. The idea of a $ 1 trillion coin got attention in 2013 when President Barack Obama struggled to get Republicans on board. Donald Marron , a tax policy expert who had led the Congressional Budget Office during part of the Bush administration , thought it wasn ' t a great idea  but not a terrible one , either. Analysts have considered a range of other options for avoiding default , including prioritizing payments , asserting the debt limit is unconstitutional , and temporarily selling the gold in Fort Knox ,  Marron said then. All raise severe practical , legal , and image problems. In this ugly group , the platinum coin looks relatively shiny.  Still , he said , it sounds like an Austin Powers sequel or a Simpsons  episode : It lacks dignity.  ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report ."

100,"In January 2016 , fire raged in the largest landfill in the Indian city of Mumbai. Located in an eastern suburb , the Deonar dumping ground stretches across 132 hectares ( 326 acres ) near Thane Creek. It receives more than 3,700 metric tons ( 8.1 million pounds ) of trash per day , about one-third of the city  s waste. With piles of trash that rise up to 30 meters ( 100 feet ) tall  the equivalent of a nine-story building  the landfill has literally become a mountain of trash. Beginning on January 27 , 2016 , sensors on the Terra , Aqua , and Suomi NPP satellites began to detect evidence of smoke and fire at the landfill. The fires continued to burn for four days , sometimes sending smoke into densely populated neighborhoods. In some parts of the city , the smoke pushed air pollution to the highest level recorded since air quality data monitoring began in June 2015 , according to the Hindustan Times. For four days , more than 70 schools closed because of the smoke. The Operational Land Imager ( OLI ) on Landsat 8 captured a natural-color image ( upper ) of the burn scar on January 28 , 2016. Smoke is streaming southwest into Baiganwadi , a neighborhood near the landfill. The false-color image ( lower ) also was acquired by OLI , but it shows the location of the hot spots more clearly because it includes observations from the shortwave infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is not clear why or how the fires started , though some news reports suggest they may have been set intentionally. Fires in landfills are often difficult to extinguish because they burn through methane , plastic , and other highly flammable substances.

101,"Marshall Burke , from the University of California , Berkeley , said : "" This is a relationship we observe across time and across all major continents around the world. The relationship we find between these climate variables and conflict outcomes are often very large . ""|||||Peacemakers are likely to be in great demand by 2050 if global warming proceeds unabated. That is the implication of a new analysis exploring the links between climate change and conflict. The work represents the first attempt to survey a burgeoning number of studies on the subject to see if they point in a common direction and to quantify the overall effect the studies identify , researchers say. The scientists conducting this "" metastudy "" estimate that if greenhouse-gas emissions from human industrial activity follow the business-as-usual path , and especially if people respond to changing climate in the future in much the same way they have throughout human history , warmer temperatures could significantly increase the risk of tribal , ethnic , or civil wars , as well as battles between countries. The largest increase in risks appears in countries in the tropics , where people are expected to bear the brunt of climate change , the researchers note. Significantly warmer temperatures and increases in extreme rainfall could push the risk of so-called group conflict up by 56 percent over today ' s risk. The risk of friction among individuals could rise by 16 percent , the study implies. They also point to a change in relative risk since 1950 , after which changes in temperature have emerged as a higher risk factor than changes in precipitation , and the risk of group violence is greater than the risk of person-to-person conflict. The researchers caution that climate clearly is not the only factor at work. Not all climate events affect all conflicts. Nor does a changing climate alone determine whether conflicts will occur. Still , "" for a long time , people have been arguing : Is there an effect or not , yes or no ? "" says Solomon Hsiang , a researcher at the University of California , Berkeley who focuses on sustainable development and the effects of climate on societies. The answer is yes , says Dr. Hsiang , who along with two colleagues from Princeton University and Berkeley conducted the analysis. The results are set to appear in Friday ' s issue of the journal Science. The new questions , he continues , are why , and how heavily does climate influence conflict compared with other influences , such as personal or national wealth , political stability within a region or country , or how governments respond to migration within or across their national borders. Other researchers exploring the links between climate , social , economic , and political conditions and conflict say the new study overstates climate ' s effect on the risk of conflict. John O ' Loughlin , a geographer at the University of Colorado at Boulder who explores the interplay of environmental conditions and conflict , notes that in his research , as in the new study , climate conditions play a role. But his own work suggests that warming temperatures or extreme precipitation are poor predictors of risk compared with the social , economic , and political drivers for conflict. Still , the new study "" really is a heroic effort. They ' re the first people to sit down and say : Can we make sense of this ? "" he says , referring to the 60 studies the team included in its analysis. The studies span some 10,000 years of human history , "" conflicts "" ranging in scales from incidents of domestic violence to all-out war , and shifts in temperatures and rainfall that range from events lasting a few hours to centuries. The studies involved criminologists , geographers , psychologists , and archaeologists who "" all had been working on related issues , "" Hsiang says. "" We set about trying to understand what everyone was finding. "" The studies varied in important ways , he adds. But once his team set the studies into "" a single coherent framework , we saw that people were seeing the same thing around the world. "" The common thread : Higher temperatures , or higher extremes in precipitation  either more of it or less of it  "" are associated with higher levels of human conflict around the world , throughout time , in different types of societies , "" Hsiang says. How tightly associated , compared with other factors linked to conflict , is another issue , other researchers say. The deepest concern about the link between climate and conflict centers on Africa , says Andrew Solow , a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts who studies sustainable development and marine resources. He points to a study conducted several years ago by researchers in Norway who noted that since the early 1990s , civil conflicts in Africa have declined , despite recent headlines , even as temperatures were warming and extreme rainfall or drought were rising. Factors that overwhelmed any climate effect on conflicts included the end of the cold war  with its proxy wars in Africa  and economies in many countries picking up steam , he says. From a policy perspective , he cautions , the new study could become a distraction , diverting attention from the need to help countries in Africa grow in a sustainable way and focus on other factors that historically have helped reduce conflicts. "" It ' s certainly worth worrying about what will the role of climate change be in all of this. We need to be thoughtful and careful about that , "" he says. But if conflict is the concern , the lesson from the Norwegian and other studies is that a higher standard of living , an equitable society , and other non-climate factors "" are where the attention is best placed. "" Others , such as Dr. O ' Loughlin , see shortcomings in the study itself that suggest the team is overreaching in its conclusions and exaggerating climate ' s effect on conflicts.

"" We are racing against time before we found them , "" Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said early Thursday. "" Now we are racing against water. "" story continues below Experts believe waiting for the waters to recede could be the safest option , but that could take months. The boys are getting diving lessons and unless efforts to find a shaft in the jungle above the cave succeed , rescuers are expected to try to get the boys out within days , starting with those best able to make the difficult journey through narrow tunnels. The military has been running hundreds of pumps in an effort to lower the water level enough for the boys to simply walk out , though one major chamber remains flooded to the ceiling , the Guardian reports. Rescuers are also trying to install an Internet cable so the boys can communicate with their parents. "" It ' s like he has been given a new life , "" the mother of a 16-year-old in the cave tells the AP. She says if he makes it out , she will never let him go near a cave again.

CNN is changing that narrative somewhat , referencing a new doctor ' s report that described the coach and two boys as experiencing exhaustion from malnutrition and quoting an unnamed Thai Navy SEALs member who says that based on the group ' s health , no extraction effort will be made on Thursday. And the timeline may be tight , with CNN reporting the area is expected to be dry until Saturday , at which point the chance of rain  and rising cave waters  spikes. It notes that the current round-trip time for the divers who have reached the boys is 11 hours. story continues below But the Guardian reports hundreds of industrial pumps continue to suck water from the cave system in hopes of draining the levels to the point where the group can don life vests and cover the 2.5-mile distance out largely on foot. A rescue official says they ' re currently focusing on draining the third chamber to waist height ; of the remaining chambers , which measure about 1.5 miles , a diver at the scene speculates about half would be walkable , with the water reaching a maximum depth of about 20 feet.

103,"Siberia is a famously cold place. But since May , it  s been extremely hot and extremely on fire. Those wildfires are so extreme that they  ve sent smoke streaming to the North Pole , and the plume is expected to reach Canada later this week. Advertisement This year  s wildfires are already outpacing last year  s record-setting season in terms of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere. Emissions from the fires are double the 2003 to 2020 average , and the flames are still spreading as fire rage out of control in an area known as the Sakha Republic. Copernicus , the European Union  s Earth Observation Program forecast that plume was likely to reach the North Pole on Monday , traveling more than 2,000 miles ( 3,219 kilometers ) to get there. Satellite images captured by NASA confirmed that forecast , with dense smoke swirling amidst the clouds over the top of the world. This marks the first time plumes from Siberian wildfires will have ever reached the region. Later this week , smoke from the Siberian fires is expected to drift even further away , reaching northern Canada where it will cloud skies and pollute the air. Parts of Canada are already struggling due to wildfires burning across the country from British Columbia to Ontario.

In inhabited areas of the Arctic , particularly those close to the wildfires themselves , they  re leading to horrible air quality issues. Any soot that falls out of the plume on sea and land ice could also speed up melting in a region already under siege from heat. That  s because dark soot can cause it to soak up more heat than lighter snow and ice. Those impacts are devastating for Indigenous communities that depend on sea ice to hunt and travel. Advertisement The fires are a symptom of the climate crisis. Officials have said the area on fire in the Sakha Republic is experiencing some of its driest conditions in 150 years , turning forests into a tinderbox. A study released in the wake of last year  s record fires shows the extreme heat that helped drive them was made 600 times more likely by the climate crisis. Scientists haven  t yet analyzed the exact role of fossil-fueled planetary warming in this year  s season , but it  s increasingly safe to assume that when there  s a heat wave happening , climate change is playing a role. In a dark twist , these fires are making the crisis worse. The carbon dioxide they  re releasing was formerly stored in trees and soil. Once it  s in the atmosphere , it will heat things up further and up the risk of more large fires . That  s why it  s never been more urgent to reduce carbon emissions by eliminating fossil fuels and protect forests from these types of infernos .|||||Smoke from raging forest fires in Siberia has reached the north pole for the first time in recorded history , as a Russian monitoring institute warned the blazes were worsening. Devastating wildfires have ripped across Siberia with increasing regularity over the past few years , which Russia  s weather officials and environmentalists have linked to climate change and an underfunded forest service. UN climate experts on Monday published a report that unequivocally shows global heating is unfolding more quickly than feared and humanity is almost entirely to blame. One of Siberia  s hardest-hit regions this year has been Yakutia  Russia  s largest and coldest region that sits atop permafrost  which has had record high temperatures and drought. Russia  s weather monitoring institute Rosgidromet said on Monday the situation in the region , also known as Sakha , continues to deteriorate  . According to Rosgidromet , close to 3.4m hectares ( 8.4m acres ) are burning in the region , including areas that are difficult to access and remote. An image released by Nasa shows smoke from hundreds of forest fires covering most of Russia on 6 August. Photograph : Nasa Earth Observatory/AFP/Getty Images On Saturday , the US space agency Nasa said its satellite images showed wildfire smoke travelling more than 3,000km ( 1,800 miles ) from Yakutia to reach the north pole  , calling it a first in recorded history  . It added that on 6 August most of Russia was covered in smoke. Environmentalists blame the authorities for letting large areas burn every year under a law that allows them not to intervene if the cost of fighting fires is greater than the damage caused or if they do not affect inhabited areas. According to Russia  s forestry agency , this year  s fires have ravaged more than 14m hectares , making it the second-worst fire season since the turn of the century. The head of Greenpeace Russia  s forest programme , Alexei Yaroshenko , linked the growing area of Russia  s wildfires with the effects of climate change as well as the continuing decline of state forest management  .|||||You are here : Home Charts|||||The new week begins with grim reading from a landmark UN report about the state of the planet.

This true-color image , which was acquired by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on board NASA  s Aqua satellite on August 6 , was created using data from four passes of the satellite over the region. The smoke , which was so thick that most of the land below was obscured from view , stretches about 2,000 miles ( 3,200 km ) from east to west and 2,500 miles ( 4,000 km ) from south to north  but it captures only a small part of the smoke from the Russian fires. This week , wildfire smoke has travelled more than 3,000 km ( 1,864 mi ) from Yakutia to reach the North Pole. The Chinese news agency , Xinhua , reported that Siberian smoke clouded the skies of parts of Mongolia , including Ulan Bator , the capital city , on August 4  a distance of more than 1,200 miles ( 2,000 km ) . On August 6 , a broad band of smoke from the wildfires , which appeared to be entrained with the clouds , could be seen over Nunavut , Canada and western Greenland. While the exact amount of forest burnt so far this year across Russia is difficult to ascertain , with different numbers recited by different sources , the emissions of carbon dioxide estimated by the European Union  s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service estimates that the emissions since June total more than 505 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The 2020 fire season was very severe , but the estimated total carbon dioxide equivalent came to 450 megatons for the entire season. This smoke primarily comes from the Sakha Republic ( Yakutia ) in Siberia. It is the largest republic in Russia and is heavily covered by boreal forest ( also known as taiga ) . The northern part of Sakha Republic has recorded some of the coldest temperatures on Earth , but this winter has set record high temperatures for the region. On August 2 , the Siberian Times reported on the intense , blinding , smoke experienced by residents of Yakutia as wildfires scorched the land. Their report read , the Republic of Sakha , Russia  s largest territory , used to be known as the Kingdom of Permafrost , ( now ) is turning into the Capital of Wildfires  . At that time , they estimated that two million hectares of the Republic had been engulfed in flames this year. EDITOR ' S NOTE : On August 13 we updated this article to remove any suggestion that this may be the first appearance of Siberian wildfire smoke over the North Pole in recorded history. An absolute determination of the first occurrence is not possible at this time.

104,"Republican Sen. Rick Scott started a spat with Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over which party is to blame for not approving disaster aid for Puerto Rico. "" We are so close to getting funding to help FL and PR recover after devastating storms. But the Dems keep holding it up. They need to stop making disaster relief a partisan fight ! Let  s get this done NOW ! "" Scott tweeted March 25. We are so close to getting funding to help FL and PR recover after devastating storms. But the Dems keep holding it up. They need to stop making disaster relief a partisan fight ! Let  s get this done NOW ! https://t.co/4NTXdkDpMd  Rick Scott ( @SenRickScott ) March 25 , 2019 In subsequent tweets , Scott repeatedly called out Schumer , saying that the Democrats are delaying funding. After Hurricane Sandy @SenSchumer said We  ve waited 91 long days. We can  t wait any longer.  Well Floridians have waited for 5 months and the Democrats keep coming up with new ways to delay funding for Florida and Puerto Rico. I won  t accept that ; families need this funding now !  Rick Scott ( @SenRickScott ) March 27 , 2019 "" Why are Republicans blocking a simple measure that helps Puerto Rico actually access the recovery aid they need , @SenRickScott ? Billions of dollars Congress approved a year ago for disaster recovery remain in the U.S. Treasury  not assisting our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. "" Why are Republicans blocking a simple measure that helps Puerto Rico actually access the recovery aid they need , @SenRickScott ? Billions of dollars Congress approved a year ago for disaster recovery remain in the U.S. Treasury  not assisting our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. https://t.co/7KBHnzzBjP  Chuck Schumer ( @SenSchumer ) March 28 , 2019 Scott replied : "" When was the last time you were in Puerto Rico , @SenSchumer ? ( Vacations don  t count ) . I  ve gone 9 times since Maria and support PR getting the funding they need , including the $ 600 million in $ $ you  re currently blocking. Leaders in PR agree that they need this funding now. "" We found that the two parties can  t seem to agree how much aid is necessary or appropriate , and that difference is slowing down the whole process. Key takeaways Democrats in the Senate have been lobbying to pass legislation that helps Puerto Rico , but you wouldn  t get that from Scott  s tweets. The big question : Will the Democrats go along with a GOP measure that has some relief for Puerto Rico , or hold out for more ? While Scott has bashed Democrats for not supporting a version of disaster relief legislation that he co-sponsored , that ignores the other disaster relief bills in the House and Senate that have moved forward. ( Also when he broadly criticizes the Democrats , he ignores that one of the eight senators joining him on his bill is Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama. ) Ironically , in one of Scott  s tweets blaming the Democrats , he linked to an Associated Press article that said Trump  s commitment to help Puerto Rico is in question , while Republicans and Democrats support moving ahead with aid. Schumer  s counterpunch also requires further explanation : His criticism focuses on Republicans who haven  t shown interest in a recent amendment by a Democrat to beef up aid to Puerto Rico. Here  s what both sides are doing Here  s a quick recap of the legislative activity : Over in the House , on Jan. 16 , six Republicans joined the Democrats to pass HR 268 , which included $ 12.1 billion for recovery from wildfires , hurricanes , and other recent natural disasters. The legislation included $ 600 million for Puerto Rico in disaster nutrition assistance. That same day , the Trump administration wrote a letter calling $ 600 million for food funding for Puerto Rico "" excessive and unnecessary. "" The Republicans wrote their own version of a bill for $ 12.7 billion for disaster relief in January , amid the negotiations to end the federal government shutdown , but it didn  t move forward. Ultimately the budget deal Trump signed in February to end the shutdown included no disaster relief. Sen. David Perdue , R-Ga. , then wrote a bill cosponsored by Scott that included the $ 600 million for food for Puerto Rico. This version never got a vote. But a similar GOP version does appear to be moving ahead. On March 26 , Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby , R-Ala. , introduced a GOP version of the January House bill. He too included the $ 600 million in food assistance for Puerto Rico , calling it "" a key Democratic priority in the bill. "" The GOP version includes relief for the midwest from flooding and tornadoes in 2019 that occurred after the House passed its bill. Reported comments from Trump at a private luncheon with GOP senators added more drama to the funding dilemma. Multiple news reports stated that Trump criticized Puerto Rico  s past use of disaster aid , arguing it had received too much. The impasse came to a head later in the day when the Senate voted 90-10 vote to move the House legislation forward , with Scott voting in favor. On April 1 , the Senate is expected to take up the House Democrats  version and Shelby  s GOP version. The question now is how much money for Puerto Rico will survive in whatever version the GOP-led Senate passes. Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , said the Puerto Rico provisions were a "" sticking point "" on the negotiations. He told The Hill that if aid to Puerto Rico is reduced , many Democrats would vote against it. That would put Democrats in the precarious position of voting against disaster aid a year before an election , and it  s unclear how many would take that risk. News reports said that Democrats gave Republicans a few options to move forward , including an amendment by Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , that included additional money for Puerto Rico including to rebuild damaged water systems and ensure resiliency for future storms. Leahy  s amendment also calls for forcing the federal government to speed up the process to allocate a separate pot of disaster money , including $ 8.3 billion for Puerto Rico , that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced in 2018 that it would allocate. The hold up is that the federal government hasn  t finalized the rules related to the funding. ( When Schumer said billions approved a year ago remain unspent , this is what he was referring to. ) It  s not only Senate Democrats who have called out the feds to hurry up to loosen the purse strings. Republican senators from Texas , Ted Cruz and John Cornyn , and Gov. Greg Abbott sent a letter to federal officials asking that the government take steps to free up $ 4.3 billion for flood mitigation earmarked for Texas. ( Many Texas representatives including Democrats also signed the letter. ) Almost one year after HUD allocated that funding , "" Texas cannot begin to utilize this important funding because HUD has not published the rules governing their use in the Federal Register , "" the Republican senators wrote. Back to the vote upcoming April 1. It appears that both parties want to pass disaster aid including for Puerto Rico , but it  s unclear where they will land. We sent a summary of our findings to Steve Ellis , vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a nonpartisan expert on the federal budget. He said there  s plenty of blame to go around : "" It seems like Senate Democrats are going to defeat the disaster supplemental to gain leverage on the disaster supplemental that will emerge like a Phoenix from the flames of current one. You could say that Democrats are holding it up. You can also say that the Republicans are not being as generous as the Democrats want. "" But there are also hold-ups with previously appropriated disaster funds because of HUD. It is a mess. I don  t know if the president  s criticism is really holding things up. They seem to be on separate tracks . ""|||||Puerto Rico ' s official death toll from Hurricane Maria has long stood at 64 , despite independent assessments that the figure is much too low. The government now agrees , in a big way. In a report to be made public Thursday , Puerto Rico raises the total by a factor of more than 20 to 1,427 , reports the New York Times. The higher figure comes in a report the territory commissioned from George Washington University , notes the AP. It will be presented to Congress as part of Puerto Rico ' s request for $ 139 billion in recovery funds. story continues below "" The hurricanes ' devastating effects on people ' s health and safety cannot be overstated , "" the government says in the report. The death toll includes not just those directly killed by the storm , but those affected by the catastrophic damage to infrastructure in the hurricane ' s aftermath.

About a million customers were left without power as a slow-moving storm pummeled the region , causing at least three deaths. Louisiana surveys the wreckage left by Hurricane Ida. Video Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon , La. , on Sunday , the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , slamming the southeastern coast with dangerous winds and storm surge and leaving most residents without power. Credit Credit ... Edmund D. Fountain for The New York Times As people across southeastern Louisiana began to take in the scale of damage from Hurricane Ida on Monday , a task severely hindered by widespread power outages and limited phone service , search-and-rescue teams fanned out to respond to calls for help that had gone unanswered. In Jefferson Parish , where there have been reports of people climbing into their attics to escape rising waters , the authorities had received at least 200 rescue calls since Sunday and crews were anxious to get to those who may still need their help , said Cynthia Lee Sheng , president of Jefferson Parish. More than 70 people were rescued from the fishing village of Jean Lafitte on Monday , she said , though one woman there was found dead. Two other deaths had been attributed to the storm by Monday evening , though state officials say they expect to learn of more. New Orleans remained without electricity. All eight transmission lines that deliver power to the city were knocked out of service by Ida , which made landfall late Sunday morning near Port Fourchon with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles an hour. The storm caused catastrophic transmission damage  to the electrical system , leaving over a million utility customers without power. Five hospitals had been evacuated or were actively considering evacuation on Monday afternoon , said a spokesman for the state department of health. Entergy , a major power company in Louisiana , said on Twitter on Monday that it would most likely take days to determine the extent of damage to our power grid and far longer to restore electrical transmission to the region.  The New Orleans mayor , LaToya Cantrell , urged residents who had evacuated not to return to the city anytime soon , given the outages and other challenges it is facing in the aftermath of the storm. Now is not the time for re-entry into the city of New Orleans ,  she said at a news conference on Monday afternoon , later adding : Again , if you evacuated , stay where you are. We will notify you when it is safe to go home.  Image A damaged building in New Orleans on Monday. Credit ... Edmund D. Fountain for The New York Times Dozens of streets in New Orleans were flooded with runoff from the storm  s heavy rains , according to the National Weather Service , which advised people to remain sheltered in place. But the system of levees , barriers and pumps that protects New Orleans appeared to have held firm against the onslaught of Hurricane Ida , officials said , passing the most dramatic test since being expanded and hardened after Hurricane Katrina. In a news conference on Monday afternoon , John Bel Edwards , the Louisiana governor , said he was thankful that the flood protection system kept the damage of Hurricane Ida from being far worse than it might have been , but he also prepared residents of south Louisiana for a tough slog ahead with more than a million people without power. This was an extremely catastrophic storm ,  the governor said. If there  s a silver lining , and today it  s kind of hard to see that , it is that our levee systems really did perform extremely well.  Ms. Lee Sheng said in an interview that Jefferson Parish officials had not yet been able to make contact with residents of Grand Isle , a narrow beachy islet of homes on stilts facing the Gulf of Mexico , near where the storm came ashore. Though many residents evacuated before the storm , she estimated that about 40 people had remained behind. Sheriff Joseph Lopinto of Jefferson Parish said on Monday afternoon that a crew was able to see Grand Isle by helicopter , getting thumbs up from people on the ground. Grand Isle got hammered probably harder than they  ve ever been hammered before ,  the sheriff said in an interview with WWL radio.

Fountain for The New York Times Still , across the parish , including in storm-pummeled areas like Grand Isle and Lafitte , damage varied from house to house , he said. Houses raised 10 feet in the air survived , while those closer to the ground did not , he said. Several small towns in the southern half of the parish , outside the giant storm protection system encircling New Orleans and some of its suburbs , were inundated , Ms. Lee Sheng said. The levees surrounding the towns had overtopped , she said , sending several hundred people who were there riding out the storm into attics and onto roofs. The further south you go , you are having very high water ,  she said , adding that search-and-rescue teams went out at first light on Monday morning. Over 240,000 people in the parish were affected by water outages , according to figures from the state department of health. Officials in Jefferson Parish , as with those in New Orleans and in other parishes across southeastern Louisiana , urged people who had left before the storm not to return immediately. We  re asking people to stay away ,  the sheriff said. Image Residents drove through the badly flooded Wheel Estates Mobile Home Park in Laplace , La. , on Monday. Credit ...

Map : Where Ida Has Left Louisiana and Mississippi Without Power These maps show the storm  s route , its aftermath along the Gulf Coast and the power outages it left in its wake. People venturing out on Monday in the hardest-hit parts of the state found smashed buildings in Houma , mangled infrastructure in Bridge City and streets still submerged in LaPlace , the first hints at the regionwide fallout from a night of destruction. LaPlace , a town of quiet subdivisions where many evacuees from New Orleans had decided to settle down after Katrina , was still badly flooded in areas , and desperate calls had gone out over social media all night for boat rescues. The center of the storm crossed into western Mississippi on Monday , slowing and weakening as it swept northward. By late afternoon it had weakened to a tropical depression , with its maximum sustained winds diminished to 35 miles an hour , but was still producing heavy rain. Its path was expected to curve northeastward into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday , where some areas may get six to eight inches of rainfall.

Large oak trees smashed into homes where terrified families took shelter as Hurricane Ida tore through. Windows of quaint local shops shattered. Debris spread across roads , making them impossible to navigate. Residents of Houma , a small city about 60 miles southwest of New Orleans , stepped out on Monday from the refuges where they rode out the Category 4 storm , and took stock of a region battered. Jazmine Carter , 20 , said she and her parents had watched in horror on Sunday night as a giant tree a few feet away from their house broke and crashed into the one next door , while power lines flew around them. Trees were falling everywhere  it was scary ,  said Ms. Carter , a cashier at a local Walgreens store. Her mother , Hannah Carter , 39 , said , I  ve never seen anything like it.  The trees and power lines were swaying back and forth , and then they finally snapped ,  she added. It was horrifying.  She turned to look at her daughter , who was surveying the damage around her. At least nobody got hurt or died ,  she said. That  s really what matters.  Image Tina LaCaze and her husband , James LaCaze , retrieved belongings from their damaged house in Gray , La. , outside Houma. Credit ... Callaghan O ' Hare for The New York Times In Houma and surrounding communities , electric power was expected to be out for days , and perhaps weeks , officials said. On Monday , Shanell Short , 35 , watched as two men picked up debris that covered most of her block  mostly tree branches , trash and utility cables. This is going to take a long time to clean up ,  she said. A woman nearby saluted a parade of ambulances driving down Main Street. One hair salon in town lost its front wall , leaving the chairs and supplies inside in plain view. Francisco Del Angel Morales , 48 , and his 10-year-old son looked on in awe , surprised that the chairs and even candy on the counter seemed untouched  as if the wall had disappeared with a magic trick. It  s all very surreal ,  Mr. Morales said. This whole area looks completely devastated.  In a neighborhood of trailer homes , some were torn in half , and many more had lost walls or roofs. It  s total destruction everywhere you look ,  said Clifford Conerly , 43 , a landscaper. Craig Adams , 53 , had planned to spend the night of the storm in his beige-colored trailer , but his daughter had begged him at 9 p.m. to seek shelter somewhere sturdier. On Monday , he was thankful she had. The two-bedroom trailer was wrecked , with only the air-conditioner surviving among piles of mangled furniture , kitchen supplies and personal belongings. Every little thing that I owned and had , it  s gone ,  Mr. Adams said. I  m going to have to start all over again. You always see other people going through this on the news. You never think it  s going to be you  until it is.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story Never again ,  a mother vows , after the safest place she could find was her car. Image Residents walked down a flooded residential street in Norco , La. , near LaPlace on Monday. Credit ... Scott Olson/Getty Images LaPLACE , La.  The power was out. The wind was uprooting trees around her house and peeling the shingles from her roof. The driving rain started pouring into the house , even seeping out through the electrical sockets. Lea Joseph took her children out to the car , where they tried to sleep. Though the car was shaking as the storm passed , it still felt safer than the house. Her mind was racing with fear and , as she described it , all of the what-ifs , imagining the worst outcomes and what might have happened if she had tried to flee before Hurricane Ida swept in. I felt bad , because I should have left with my kids ,  she said. I  m scared. My son is crying. He kept asking , When is the eye passing , when is the eye passing?  They know what  s going on.  With the big blow past on Monday , her 13-year-old son , Cesar , showed videos he had shared with his friends on Snapchat , recording the wind and the water as the storm descended on their home. I wasn  t scared ,  he said. My brothers were.  He recalled that Cesar  s 11-year-old brother , Juan , kept calling out , Hold the door , hold the door.  I was crying ,  Juan said on Monday as he stood on a flooded street , the water lapping over his rubber boots. He was scared , he said , but also relieved to be on the other side of the storm. His mother  s regrets had not ebbed. My car ain  t the best to be driving ,  she said , but I should have drove it like that.  When the next storm comes to southeastern Louisiana , will she try to ride it out ? Never again , never again ,  Ms. Joseph said. Not as long as I  ve got little ones. Not a Category 1. Not anything.  In many ways , she knew , the storm was not over. Her home had been severely damaged , and it could be weeks before electricity returns. Even so , she said , We  re trying to keep as calm as possible for the children.  In LaPlace , a city of just under 30,000 people on the eastern bank of a crook in the Mississippi River , many houses were left mangled and streets remained flooded on Monday. Water covered the pavement on Whitlow Court , a strip of mobile homes that had been rattled and battered by Ida. Every truck that tried to drive down the street created a wake. Neighborhood residents were hungry and tired. The water supply was out. So was the electricity. No one had any cellphone service. David Sanford considered himself something of a hurricane veteran : He moved to Louisiana eight years ago from Pensacola on the equally storm-prone Florida coast. Even so , Ida terrified him , he said. The storm set his mobile home vibrating , and a skylight over the bathroom popped , dumping rainwater inside. It was just rough ,  Mr. Sanford , 64 , recounted , sitting back on a dry patch at the end of the street on Monday. This one right here was the worst one I  ve been in.  The howling wind didn  t slack up at all ,  he said. That was a huge storm.

Will Widmer for The New York Times The $ 14.5 billion flood-protection system built around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina seems to have succeeded at keeping the city from going underwater again. As of Monday morning , water from Hurricane Ida had not pushed past , or overtopped ,  any of the 192 miles of flood barriers that make up that system , according to the Flood Protection Authority , the local agency that runs the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System. Nor have any of those barriers suffered a structural failure , called a breach. And while most of New Orleans is without power , the pumps that are designed to move flood water out of the city still work , because those pumps run on generators , according to the flood authority. In short , the system worked , according to Elizabeth Zimmerman , who ran disaster operations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Obama administration. It  s a major accomplishment ,  Ms. Zimmerman said. The things that were built were a major step forward.  In a news conference on Monday afternoon , John Bel Edwards , the Louisiana governor , said he was thankful that the flood-protection system kept the hurricane damage from being far worse than it might have been. If there  s a silver lining , and today it  s kind of hard to see that , it is that our levee systems really did perform extremely well ,  he said. But that success doesn  t mean residents are safe. It  s a good time to remind people that just because the storm has passed , it doesn  t mean that dangers have not ,  Mr. Edwards said , referring to the deaths caused by accidents with generators that have followed past storms. There are an awful lot of unknowns right now ,  he added. There are certainly more questions than answers. I can  t tell you when the power is going to be restored. I can  t tell you when all the debris is going to be cleaned up and repairs made and so forth.  All eight transmissions lines that bring electricity into the city are out of service , according to a statement Sunday by Entergy , the power utility. On Monday , the company said 216 substations and more than 2,000 miles of transmission lines were out of service. Those in the hardest-hit areas could experience power outages for weeks ,  the company said in a statement. Four hospitals were damaged in Louisiana , according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. New Orleans  s 911 call system was down , Mayor LaToya Cantrell wrote on Twitter. City officials pleaded with residents to stay off the roads. Now is not the time to leave your home ,  the New Orleans Police Department wrote on Twitter. There is no power. Trees , limbs and lines are down everywhere.  The fact that New Orleans has no electricity , despite huge investments in storm protection over the past 16 years , demonstrates the challenge of adapting to climate change , according to Daniel Kaniewski , who was in charge of resilience at FEMA until 2020. The work that followed Katrina focused on preventing a repeat of catastrophic flooding , said Mr. Kaniewski , now a managing director at the professional services company Marsh McLennan. But that work focused less on other types of infrastructure , like the power grid. If we  re only preparing for the last disaster , we  ll never be prepared for the next one ,  he said.

We already know there  s been at least one confirmed death and a number , that number is likely to grow. And I  ve got , we  ve got a million people in Louisiana without power. And for a time , Ida caused the Mississippi River to literally change its direction. And some folks are still dealing with the storm surge and flash flooding. And there are roads that are impassable due to debris and downed power lines. And we need people to continue to shelter in place if it  s safe for them to do so. The people of Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient and , but , it  s in moments like these that we can certainly see the power of government to respond to the needs of the people , if governments are prepared and if they respond. That  s our job , if we work together , folks get knocked down , we  re there to help you get back on your feet. The most important element , though , is coordinating all the branches of government , state , local and federal. President Biden met virtually with leaders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pledged his support to Louisiana after Hurricane Ida hit the coast. The Category 4 hurricane has now been downgraded to a tropical storm. President Biden on Monday promised people in Louisiana and Mississippi that his administration would be there to help them recover from the damage wrought by Hurricane Ida for as long as it takes.  We know Hurricane Ida had the potential to cause massive , massive damage , and that  s exactly what we saw ,  he said , speaking during a virtual news conference with state and local officials. We  re about as prepared as we could be for the early stage of this , so there  s a lot more to do.  Mr. Biden said his administration had resources in place in the region before the hurricane made landfall , including millions of meals and liters of water and more than 200 generators , with more on the way to help with the vast power failures in Louisiana. More than 5,000 National Guard troops have been deployed to help with the search-and-rescue efforts. He said the storm surge and flash flooding in the region was continuing , with roads blocked from debris and downed power lines. We need people to continue to shelter in place , if it  s safe for them to do so ,  he said. Jen Psaki , the White House press secretary , said Alejandro N. Mayorkas , the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , and Deanne Criswell , the FEMA administrator , planned to travel to Baton Rouge on Tuesday morning. Ms. Psaki said Ms. Criswell planned to go on to Jackson , Miss. , that evening before meeting with Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi on Wednesday to tour the damage from Ida. Ms. Psaki said there were no immediate plans for Mr. Biden to travel to the region because the White House does not want to affect the response efforts. A presidential visit requires more local resources for logistics and security than do visits by other administration officials. People in Louisiana and Mississippi are resilient ,  Mr. Biden said. But it  s in moments like these , we can certainly see the power of government responding to the needs of the people , if government  s prepared , and if they respond.  He said , We  re going to stand with you and the people of the Gulf for as long as it takes for you to recover.  In addition to the meals , water and generators sent to Louisiana before the storm , Ms. Psaki said more than 3,600 FEMA employees have been deployed to Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas. The Department of Health and Human Services also provided a 250-bed federal medical shelter to Alexandria , La. , which is about two hours from Baton Rouge. More than 300 federally deployed health care workers are on the ground to help stem the spread of Covid-19 , she said. The state has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country and has been overwhelmed in recent weeks with new cases. Scenes of damage from Hurricane Ida. Jean Lafitte Edmund D.

Uprooted trees and broken branches were everywhere , from the Bywater neighborhood to Uptown. St. Charles Avenue , a grand uptown boulevard , was clogged with tree limbs and littered with green. In the French Quarter , the streets seemed to have been washed almost clean. A roof had come down in a twisted mess of tar from a pink four-story building at Toulouse and Decatur Streets , attracting TV news crews looking for signs of damage. An old brick building near City Hall had been dramatically blown to bits by the wind. Bricks were littered in heaps , and had crushed a nearby car. Mayor LaToya Cantrell told New Orleanians to remain indoors , but a few had begun venturing out to walk their dogs , ride bikes and assess the state of things. Though the city looked sturdy and dry on the outside , they knew the drama would now unfold indoors , where the lights might not be coming on for days. Image Residents began clearing streets in New Orleans on Monday. Credit ... Edmund D. Fountain for The New York Times In the Algiers Point neighborhood , Melissa DeRussy , her husband , Husted , and their two teenage children were already out by 9 a.m. , raking up leaves and small branches torn from the oak trees on their block. All over the neighborhood , the steady hum of generators blended with the sounds of neighbors checking in on one another and looking things over. Roof shingles were sprinkled across lawns. A palm tree on one block was ripped in half about six feet from the ground , and a nearby magnolia looked as through it had been dropped into a blender. Overnight , it was a little exciting ,  Ms. DeRussy said. Every bump  from possibly the house next door  we had to investigate until it got dark. Then we just couldn  t investigate any more.  With power knocked out across the city , Ms. DeRussy , who works for a local school , said the family  s next steps were up in the air. My colleagues are scattered across the Gulf Coast ,  she said There are just a lot of unknowns this morning.  At the New Orleans Fire Department station on Poland Avenue , a generator powered the lights and kitchen , but its firefighters were relying on hand-held radios for communication with the outside world. We  re all in the dark right now ,  said a firefighter who sat near the station  s open garage doors on Monday morning , ready to help anyone walking up for help. For the most part , we  re getting messages by ear.  Residents who have lived through other storms said they were not phased  yet  by the power outages and boil-water advisories. Guess what ? This is part of life in New Orleans ,  said Antoine Davis , 58 , as he stopped at Duplantier Ice at the edge of the French Quarter to get some bags of ice to keep his refrigerator cold. This is something I have been dealing with all of my life , because I live here. If we lived in California , there would be fires and earthquakes. If we lived in Tennessee right now , we  d have floods.  Richard Fausset , Chelsea Brasted and Louisiana is grappling with oxygen shortages in Ida  s aftermath. Image Oxygen tanks in the Covid-19 ward at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital in Lake Charles , La. , this month. Hospitals inundated with coronavirus patients have struggled to maintain their oxygen supply. Credit ... Mario Tama/Getty Images Oxygen supplies are running critically low in hospitals across Louisiana  with some only having one or two days of supply left  and any interruption brought by Hurricane Ida  s destruction could be serious , according to Premier Inc. , one of the largest hospital supply purchasing groups in the country. Ida pummeled much of the state on Sunday evening , leaving hundreds of thousands without power at a moment when hospitals across the Southeast had already been struggling with oxygen shortages for weeks. Driven by a surge in Covid-19 cases , some hospitals are relying on reserve tanks with no other backup options. This is a rapidly evolving situation with access and roads  it remains to be seen what might happen in the days ahead ,  said Premier  s chief customer officer , Andy Brailo. What we all want to avoid , obviously , is hospitals not being able to have the adequate oxygen supply for their patients or putting their patients at risk.  He said delivery trucks have been giving hospitals partial refills because demand had been so high. Supply is further limited because oxygen needs to be delivered within hours , meaning that supplies must come from within a 250-mile radius of a hospital , he added. Premier is coordinating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the scarcity of oxygen in the region. The shortage goes beyond hospital supply. Mr. Brailo said individual canisters and tanks used by discharged Covid patients and those with disabilities were also in high demand. CrowdSource Rescue , a volunteer emergency response group , performed about a dozen oxygen-related rescues on Monday , including one of a woman who was dependent on oxygen after a Covid-19 infection , according to Loren Dykes , the group  s director of operations. In the days ahead , Ms. Dykes said she expected to receive more oxygen-related distress calls , especially for Covid patients , who she said were not going to be as prepared as people with disabilities , who have more experience and tend to stockpile supplies. New Orleans has opened oxygen exchange sites for residents to get a full free tank of oxygen. Mike Hulefeld , chief operating officer for Ochsner Health , one of the largest hospital systems in Louisiana , said on Monday that thanks to generators , hospitals were faring well. The hospital network had 10 days  worth of supplies for the hospitals it anticipated would be hardest hit , and each of its locations had backup power and fuel. But those who rely on ventilators or oxygen concentrators to help them breathe , including recently discharged Covid-19 patients , are also going to be at increased risk because of the power outages. According to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services data on Medicare beneficiaries , there are 3,706 Medicare beneficiaries in Jefferson Parish who are dependent on power for their medical devices ; in Orleans Parish , 2,215 Medicare beneficiaries are medically dependent on power.

Credit ... Callaghan O ' Hare for The New York Times When Hurricane Ida made landfall on Louisiana  s southeastern coast just before noon on Sunday , its maximum sustained winds were roaring at 150 miles an hour. Nearly 10 hours later and 80 miles inland , its maximum wind speeds were still clocking in at a dangerous 105 m.p.h. Hurricanes typically decay quickly once they make landfall. But experts who study the storms say there are several reasons that Ida remained so intense even as it plowed northward into Louisiana. Over dry land , and particularly over rougher terrain , wind speeds generally decrease rapidly. Hurricanes require thermal energy to fuel themselves , and the water in the ocean  or in this case , bayous and wetlands  can yield a lot of energy. But heat flows through land slowly , starving hurricanes of one of their primary energy sources. Southeastern Louisiana is flat , wet and swampy for many miles inland from the Gulf shore where Ida first hit. It doesn  t take a lot of water to keep a hurricane going ,  said Kerry Emanuel , an atmospheric scientist at M.I.T. A swamp won  t sustain a 150-mile-per-hour hurricane , but it will make sure it doesn  t decay as fast as it would over dry land.  The terrain was not all that contributed to Ida  s continuing intensity. Most often when storms hit land , they are already in the process of leveling off or decaying. The unusual case of a hurricane making landfall while still intensifying rapidly is a forecaster  s nightmare ,  Dr. Emanuel said. Ida was in that category , and after passing the Louisiana shoreline , it took a number of hours to finally adjust to its transition from sea to land. A new plant was supposed to help keep New Orleans  s lights on. It didn  t. Image Entergy  s new New Orleans plant , while under construction next to an older , decommissioned plant , in 2019. Credit ... William Widmer for The New York Times The widespread loss of power in New Orleans wasn  t supposed to happen again. Entergy , the power company serving the city , campaigned to build a new natural gas-fueled power plant in the city , arguing that it was needed for just this kind of situation , when the transmission system that normally supplies the city with power generated elsewhere can  t do the job. Over protests from numerous community groups and city leaders , Entergy got its way , and the plant was built just south of Interstate 10 and Lake Pontchartrain , bordering predominantly African American and Vietnamese American neighborhoods. It went into operation last year , running mainly at times of peak demand. But when Hurricane Ida knocked out the transmission lines on Sunday , the plant did not save the day for the city. Power was out almost everywhere on Monday , with little prospect of a swift return. And many residents are unhappy. The gas plant was built over our objections ,  said Monique Harden , assistant director for public policy at the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice , one of the leading organizations fighting the gas plant. No resident was in support of it. Nonetheless , Entergy with the City Council teamed together and got the gas plant.  Susan Guidry , a former council member , argued at the time that Entergy should have focused instead on renewable energy technologies like solar power and battery storage to help keep the lights on in New Orleans after a hurricane. But while the utility did build some of that , the gas plant became the focus of its plans. If anything happened to the transmission , this gas plant was supposed to supply power to the City of New Orleans ,  Ms. Harden said. This is going to require some investigation.  Ms. Harden  s organization and others argued for microgrids and other resources that could operate even if the traditional electric grid was knocked out of service. Some residents and businesses have their own solar installations and batteries , or are connected to such sources through microgrids , but customers who are connected only to the traditional power grid do not. Entergy has warned that it may take its crews days just to assess the damage to its system , and much longer than that to complete repairs. It  s getting more and more desperate ,  Ms. Harden said. Our lives are now in the hands of this company.  Entergy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Edmund D. Fountain for The New York Times It will take days just for utility crews to determine the extent of the storm damage to the New Orleans power grid , and far longer to restore power to the region , officials of Entergy Louisiana said on Monday. We have a lot of rebuilding ahead of us ,   the company said on Twitter. We  ll be better prepared to give restoration estimates once assessments are done.  As of 7 a.m. on Monday , Entergy said there were more than 888,000 power outages in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida thrashed much of the state Sunday evening , snapping cables , damaging buildings , uprooting trees and spreading debris along roads. On Monday morning , 216 substations , 207 transmission lines , and more than 2,000 miles of transmission lines were out of service , and the company also reported more than 45,000 outages in Mississippi. Because of Ida  s catastrophic intensity ,  all eight transmission lines that deliver power to New Orleans were out of service , Entergy officials said. The situation caused a load imbalance and resulted in a failure of all power generation in the region. The city  s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness said that the only power in the city was coming from customers  own generators. There were reports of communications disruptions as well. Telephone service appeared to be out in some of the hardest-hit areas of southeast Louisiana. And there were problems with mobile phone service. AT&T said that because of wind damage , flooding and power loss , we have significant outages in New Orleans and Baton Rouge ,  and that its wireless network in Louisiana as a whole was operating at 60 percent of normal capacity. Key network facilities were knocked off line by the storm overnight , the company said , and while some have already been restored , some facilities remain down and are inaccessible.  A spokeswoman for Verizon said on Monday that the company was still actively assessing the situation on the ground as it is safe to do so.  She added , While we are seeing sites out of service in the heaviest hit areas , overlapping sites are offering some coverage to residents and first responders who remain there.  Many cell sites were running on backup generators and batteries , she said. Image Residents of Baton Rouge wait outside an open convenience store , after much of the city lost power , on Monday. Credit ... Emily Kask for The New York Times Verizon said it was providing unlimited calling , texting and data to its customers most affected by Hurricane Ida. AT&T said it was waiving overage charges for customers in parts of Louisiana and Mississippi through Saturday. T-Mobile said on Sunday that most T-Mobile and Sprint customers in the affected area would be offered free talk , text and unlimited data through Friday. Some utility customers who were in the direct path of the hurricane may not see electric service restored for as long as three weeks , according to Entergy. But 90 percent of customers will have power back sooner , it said. Requests for comment from Entergy about the hardest hit areas and the next stages of restoration were not immediately answered early Monday. As the storm swept across the city on Sunday , Entergy said that crews from at least 22 states and Washington , D.C. , were joining the recovery effort. The company said it was working to assess damage and identify a path forward to restore power to areas that could still receive it. It added that it had provided backup generation to the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board. Including other utilities as well as Entergy , about one million customers in Louisiana were without power early Monday morning , according to reports compiled by PowerOutage.us. Most were in the southeastern part of the state. In Mississippi , about 130,000 customers were reported to be without power , mainly in the southwest , the website said. Entergy Louisiana warned customers that broken power lines can remain hazardous. Just because you can  t see any apparent danger , doesn  t mean there isn  t any ,  the company said on Monday. Downed power lines may still be energized. Keep your distance.  Derrick Bryson Taylor and Where is Ida headed next ? Image Destruction in Houma , La. , on Monday. Credit ... Adrees Latif/Reuters As the remnants of Hurricane Ida move farther inland in the coming days , the storm system is expected to lose strength but will continue to pose a danger to many parts of the Southeast , the National Hurricane Center said. Ida , which was downgraded to a tropical depression Monday afternoon , will continue to bring heavy rainfall , and possibly severe flooding , to Louisiana , the southern parts of Mississippi and coastal communities in Alabama through Monday evening. The rainfall totals could reach as much as 24 inches in some parts of southeast Louisiana. Heavy rain combined with storm surge has resulted in catastrophic impacts along the southeast coast of Louisiana , with considerable flash flooding and riverine flooding continuing farther inland ,   the Weather Service said. Coastal Alabama and the western parts of Florida could see six to 12 inches of rain through Tuesday morning , and parts of central Mississippi could see up to a foot of rain. Tornadoes have been reported in Alabama  on the outskirts of Mobile and south of Troy  and more are possible on Monday night in Southern Mississippi , southwest Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle. On Monday afternoon , the system was about 20 miles north-northwest of Jackson , Miss. , moving toward the north-northeast at 9 miles an hour with maximum sustained winds of 35 m.p.h. The storm is expected to weaken as it continues toward the northeast on Monday night , tracking toward the Middle Tennessee Valley , including Humphreys County , where 20 people were killed this month as flash floods tore through communities there. The area could see up to six inches of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday , the Hurricane Center said. The National Weather Service in Nashville issued a flood watch for most of Middle Tennessee starting on Monday night. By Wednesday , the storm is forecast to move through the Upper Ohio Valley , dropping as much as six inches of rain , and then continue into the Northeast later in the week. All of these areas could experience flash flooding , the Hurricane Center said. Johnny Diaz , Jacey Fortin and Derrick Bryson Taylor contributed reporting.

Typically , the search and rescue operation is staged two miles closer to the town of Jean Lafitte , but this one is based seven miles to the north. "" This is highest the water ever been , "" he said. "" This is historic flooding for the town. "" Ida pushed 10 to 12 feet of water into Jean Lafitte , Barataria , Crown Point and lower Lafitte. Outside the fortress-like levees protecting more populous parts of the New Orleans area , these communities have only a partial ring levee about 7 feet high to shield their homes , businesses , schools , government buildings and part of the evacuation route. Though the ring levee held , Parish Council member Ricky Templet said water rushed over it. Sheriff Joe Lopinto said water still covered the levee at midday , and it was unclear when the interior flooding would recede. Inside the levee , flooding ranged from four to 10 feet , depending on building elevation. That forced some residents into their attics. A flash flood emergency is still was in effect until 2 p.m. "" We ' ve got a lot of water that ' s really never been in these places before , "" Lopinto said.

Bonano said Monday that officials were in communication with Kerner although residents were without mobile phone service. Lopinto said authorities were working to provide the mayor with radios to communicate with residents. A police blockade prevented people from approaching the boat staging area. Bonano advised the public to stay away and let the operation proceed. "" A lot of people are trying to come down to check in their kin.

A recently arriving partial ASCAT-A overpass shows that the circulation has become more elongated , and Peter lacks a well-defined center. In addition , the system has not produced any organized deep convection in quite some time. The cloudiness and convective activity that has been occuring over the western Atlantic has been located along a trough axis well northeast of the decaying circulation center. As a result , Peter no longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone , and this will be the final NHC advisory on this system. The initial intensity is set at 25 kt in accordance with the ASCAT data. The remnants of Peter are expected to remain within an area of strong upper-level westerly winds , and further weakening should occur over the next day or two. The system has been moving slowly north-northwestward or 335/4 kt. A weakness in the low-level ridge should allow the remnants to turn northward tomorrow , and this general motion should continue through the end of the week. This is the last NHC advisory on this system.

108,"> >Seasonal Forecast Discussion Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD 830 AM EDT Thu Oct 21 2021 SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS The November-December-January 2021-2022 temperature outlook depicts elevated odds for above-normal seasonal mean temperatures along the southern half of the U.S. and for the eastern third of the nation. The greatest likelihood for warmer than normal temperatures is located across the Southwest and southern Plains. Below-normal temperatures are most likely for Southeast Alaska and a small area in the Pacific Northwest. For precipitation , above-normal seasonal precipitation amounts are favored for the west coast of Alaska , the Pacific Northwest , northern Rockies and portions of the Great Lakes , Ohio Valley and Northeast. Drier-than-normal conditions are most likely for south-central Alaska and along the southern tier of the U.S. from California eastward to the southern Plains and Southeast. La Nina conditions have emerged in the Pacific Ocean and its influence contributed substantially to the temperature and precipitation outlooks through the winter months into the early Spring 2022. BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS Note : For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See : http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/tools/briefing CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS La Nina conditions have developed in the Pacific Ocean as indicated by both ocean and atmospheric indicators and a La Nina Advisory was issued earlier in October. Equatorial Pacific ocean surface temperature departures are negative from just west of the Date Line to the South American coast with anomalies generally ranging from -0.5 to -1.0 degrees C. The latest weekly Nino3.4 region SST departure was -0.8 degrees C. A strong reservoir of colder than normal water is observed via ocean temperatures along the equator from 160 W to 100 W at a depth ranging from just below the surface to 200 meters depth from the eastern to the central Pacific respectively. The negative ocean temperature anomalies in this area surpasses -6.0 degrees C at their current peak. This colder than average water supports further surface cooling over time as we enter the winter months in the equatorial Pacific. The integrated oceanic heat content continues to become more negative and is currently at levels more negative than this time last year. The atmospheric state is displaying characteristics consistent with La Nina with enhanced convection on average in proximity to Indonesia and suppressed convection near the Date Line. Trade winds are enhanced and upper-level westerly wind anomalies are present in the central Pacific. Below-normal sea surface temperatures ( SSTs ) are present in surrounding waters around Alaska and cooling of near and offshore waters off the U.S. West coast are now evident - consistent with the typical La Nina atmospheric response. Above-normal SSTs are evident along the eastern seaboard , especially off the Northeast coast. PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS The CPC Nino3.4 SST consolidation forecast shows a continued decrease in anomalous SST through DJF 2021-2022 to near -1.0 degrees C with the statistical model components indicating less negative anomalous values while the dynamical model sources such as those from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble ( NMME ) suggest a stronger event. The NMME ensemble mean shows a decrease to near -1.5 degrees C over the same period. The latter , however , is influenced by some members that appear to be cold outliers as compared to the majority of the other guidance. The CPC / IRI official ENSO outlook depicts high probabilities ( greater than 90 % through NDJ 2021-2022 and greater than 75 % through JFM 2022 ) for La Nina , with these odds decreasing to near 60 % in FMA 2022. PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS Potential typical impacts known to be associated with La Nina winters are utilized in preparation of the outlook via common techniques that include composite analysis ( including consecutive La Nina events ) and regressions anchored to Nino3.4 SST in both diagnostic and prognostic terms. La Nina impacts were considered through the MAM 2022 forecast lead. Dynamical model guidance from the NMME and Copernicus ( C3S ) multi-model ensemble systems are also used through MAM 2022. In addition , objective , skill-based consolidation tools contribute to the outlook and include the ENSO/OCN and complete suite statistical/dynamical tool combinations. Statistical guidance such as the global SST based CA , CBaM guidance and long term temperature and precipitation trends played a role in many of the outlook seasons. Coastal SSTs also are considered especially at the early leads. PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - NDJ 2021 TO NDJ 2022 TEMPERATURE The NDJ 2021-2022 temperature outlook favors above-normal temperatures for the southern half of the U.S. and also for the eastern third of the CONUS with below-normal temperatures most likely for a small area in the Pacific Northwest and for Southeast Alaska. The expectation of La Nina conditions and associated typical impacts - on average over many events - is the primary driver of the evolution of the temperature outlooks from NDJ 2021-2022 through the MAM 2022 lead as indicated by multiple methods that includes empirical , statistical and dynamical forecast guidance. The dynamical model guidance suite ( NMME and C3S ) strongly represents an atmospheric response consistent with La Nina across the forecast domain. Moreover , the NMME seems to depict a more robust , amplified ENSO forced wave train over the Pacific Ocean and North America as compared to its forecasts from last month. This is not overly surprising given the most recent NMME SST forecasts of potentially more anomalously negative equatorial Pacific SSTs. The temperature guidance is colder in areas such as Alaska ( considerably so ) , western Canada and in the western CONUS , bleeding eastward into the northern Plains. Model probabilities for above-normal temperatures in areas such as the southeast , mid-South , mid-Atlantic and Northeast are greater than that depicted last month. The official outlooks over time increase coverage of below-normal temperatures for the Pacific Northwest eastward to the northern High Plains in DJF 2021-2022 and JFM 2022 and relax this area northward ( less coverage and lower probabilities ) in FMA and MAM 2022. A forecast for colder conditions for areas along the central U.S. West coast and the Alaska domain is indicated from the previous set of seasonal outlooks released in September. The greatest odds for above-normal temperatures slowly shifts from the Southwest and southern Plains in NDJ 2021-2022 to the Southeast and lower eastern seaboard during JFM 2022 and then along the Gulf coast and Texas in FMA and MAM 2022. La Nina events are often characterized by high subseasonal variability especially from the north-central CONUS to the Northeast as these areas are strongly impacted by variations in the AO/NAO and potential stratospheric influences ( typically more likely during the second half of winters ) - all of which can not be very difficult to reliably predict at these lead times. Consequently , the coverage of Equal-Chances ( EC ) increases in the these areas in FMA and MAM 2022. The remaining set of temperature outlooks remain generally the same from the September release and are based on the ENSO/OCN and other consolidation forecast tools for which long term temperature trends contribute significantly at times in various regions. PRECIPITATION For the NDJ 2021-2022 precipitation outlook , above-normal seasonal precipitation amounts are most likely for the west coast of Alaska , the Pacific Northwest , northern Rockies and portions of the Great Lakes , Ohio Valley and Northeast. Above-normal Great Lakes surface temperatures with the potential for enhanced lake effect precipitation , as compared to climatology , played some role in the outlook. Drier-than-normal conditions are most likely for south-central Alaska and along the southern tier of the U.S. from California eastward to the southern Plains and Southeast. Similar to that described above for temperature , the evolution of the precipitation outlooks through MAM 2022 are derived from the typical observed impacts during La Nina winters - on average over many events - and available dynamical model guidance. In utilizing composite analysis for second year La Nina winters , one area to note is that for the Far West and West coast , a drier signal is indicated than when utilizing information from all La Nina winters. Although the sample size is low , this adds to normally high uncertainty in this region and so any tilt in probabilities from normal odds are low with considerable area highlighted with EC. The remaining set of outlooks are primarily based on the forecast consolidation of statistical guidance and long term precipitation trends . FORECASTER : Jon Gottschalck The Climatic normals are based on conditions between 1991 and 2020 , following the World Meterological Organization convention of using the most recent 3 complete decades as the climatic reference period. The probability anomalies for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

Hurricane names , explained Katrina , Maria , Harvey and Sandy are all infamous names belonging to some of the worst hurricanes in history. But where do these names come from ? Just the FAQs , USA TODAY On Wednesday , Dorian battered the Virgin Islands , parts of Puerto Rico and its island-municipalities of Vieques and Culebra with powerful winds and heavy rainfall , which could lead to life-threatening flash flooding through Thursday morning. A hurricane warning was in effect for both U.S. and British Virgin Islands , as well as Vieques and Culebra. Puerto Rico was under a hurricane watch , and 100 flights to and from the main airport were canceled , but the U.S. territory was spared a direct hit. Stay up to date on Dorian day and night : The Evening Briefing newsletter brings the news straight to your inbox On Thursday , Dorian should be east of the Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas , likely growing to a Category 2 hurricane by the evening. By Friday or Saturday , forecasters expect it near or to the east of the central and northwestern Bahamas. The hurricane was about 90 miles north of San Juan , Puerto Rico , as of 11 p.m. Wednesday , moving at 13 mph. "" Heavy rains are expected to occur over portions of the Bahamas , Florida , and elsewhere in the southeastern United States later this week and into early next week , ' ' the hurricane center said , urging residents in those areas to monitor the storm. Nuking a hurricane ? You can ' t nuke a hurricane to stop it , as Trump reportedly suggested. Here ' s why President Donald Trump has declared an emergency and ordered federal assistance for Puerto Rico the U.S. Virgin Islands. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he was tracking the storm closely , and he also took a shot at Puerto Rican officials. "" FEMA and all others are ready , and will do a great job. When they do , let them know it , and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan ! "" he said. Dorian has already battered Barbados and St. Lucia this week , downing trees and power lines. In Puerto Rico , the storm ' s threat sparked fears as the island continues to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria , which wiped out power two years ago. Ruben Rodriguez , a reporter and editor at Puerto Rico  s leading newspaper , El Nuevo Dia , said residents promptly loaded up on supplied to brace for Dorian.

Figueroa didn ' t take any chances and drove early Wednesday to his daughter ' s house in the San Juan metropolitan area , away from the hurricane ' s path. Maria left a deep scar here , and any storm provokes anxiety among people , ' ' he said. "" That  s understandable , because we haven  t totally recovered yet. There are still a lot of people with those blue tarps for roofs.   Top officials say they are prepared this time with better equipment , though some concern persists. Jos Ortiz , executive director of Puerto Rico  s Electric Power Authority , told the Associated Press that the power system still has some weak areas and could "" suffer "" given the storm ' s wind speeds. But he said the agency has thousands of lights , poles and transformers. Cristobal Jimenez , a community activist who lives in the northeastern city of Fajardo , said he went two months without power after Maria and that many in the island are wondering whether the lights will stay on after the grid repairs. Dorian will show whether the distribution lines were glued with bubble gum ,   Jimenez said. He also noted that Puerto Ricans have a much better idea now of what it takes to prepare for a hurricane , and they  re better supplied with generators , water filters , solar lamps , food and water. "" I went to help out at the church today and you could see the movement on the street didn  t have the same feeling of desperation as before , ' ' Jimenez said.

110,"David Nikel At 78 degrees north , Longyearbyen is the world  s northernmost permanently inhabited community. Rather than some remote outpost , the town of just over 2,000 people is surprisingly normal , with a supermarket , bars , church , cinema , school , and even a municipal swimming pool. Founded as a company mining town , Longyearbyen has for the last ten years or so been undergoing an economic transformation. Formerly reliant on coal mining , the town now has two other economic pillars : scientific research and tourism. While one coal mine remains , the other two pillars are growing in importance. With more researchers and students coming to the University Centre in Svalbard ( UNIS ) and tourism increasing year-on-year , the town is facing a housing crisis. New arrivals are being forced to share apartments designed for one. Several seasonal staff even talked of having to sleep on temporary beds in store rooms. Avalanche risk reduces housing numbers Climate changes are compounding the problem. Hilde Kristin Rsvik , editor of the world  s northernmost newspaper Svalbardposten , says that temperatures have been above the historic average for 96 consecutive months. The ice is melting , glaciers are shrinking , there  s more rain and more wind. Svalbard is Arctic desert , and so more moisture has increased the threat and the severity of avalanches as the snow and rock can slide more easily. Eleven houses were destroyed by an avalanche in 2015 and a near-miss in 2017 threatened many more  , she says. David Nikel Despite avalanche protection fences being installed on the mountains above the settlement , the most at-risk houses are being torn down. But building replacements isn  t straightforward. Most housing in the settlement is owned by the mining company Store Norske or Statsbygg , the property wing of the Norwegian government. There is very little private ownership because of Longyearbyen  s history as a company town. Anyone who wants to build has to apply to the local administrators and keep within a strict zoning system. Despite this , two new build projects are underway. One will provide new accommodation for students and researchers at UNIS , and the other is being built by Statsbygg. However , those apartments are being built to replace those lost in the avalanche , so it will not make much difference , if any , to the available capacity. At the time of writing Finn.no , Norway  s biggest property marketplace , lists just one house on Svalbard. The now sold three-bedroom 81m house was listed for 3.35 million Norwegian kroner , approximately $ 383,000. No responsibility for housing Many outsiders will no doubt wonder what the local authority is doing about the problem. But due to the unique way Svalbard is governed , the answer is not very much. Simply put , it  s not their responsibility. While Longyearbyen may have a lot in common with any other small Norwegian town , there are some critical differences. Although under the sovereignty of Norway , the Svalbard Treaty allows any of the 46 signatories equal rights to commercial activity. Anyone in the world can live there , as there are no work permits or visas. However , you cannot give birth or die there , there is no state welfare , and the responsibility for finding work and a home rests with the individual. If you come to Svalbard , you have to be self-sufficient and able to look after yourself or you have to leave. The local government here has no responsibility other than to their own employees  , explains long-term resident Anna Lena Ekeblad , owner of Barents Expeditions. The structure of the society is still in many ways a company town where in most cases the employers provides the housing. The newer tourist industry has not taken that sort of responsibility to take the big costs and buy or build housing.  Because of the strict zoning and planning system , there is very limited space available on which to build. Even with permission , doing so is very expensive given the need to import labor and transport building materials by ship. There are many small tourist companies who cannot afford to buy or build housing  , explains Ekeblad. Finding a sustainable balance To make matters worse , the growth of the travel industry isn  t something that some long-term locals are too keen on , which could pose problems for any potential housing projects. Locals understandably grumble when a cruise ship unloads its passengers  anything up to 4,000  into the tiny settlement. There are more frequent reports of tourists going into the wilderness on snow scooters and scaring wildlife , disturbing cultural monuments , or simply leaving trash behind. An environmental tax on incoming tourists brings in more than $ 1m per year , which is allocated to environmental projects on the islands. Many locals are demanding limits on visitor numbers , but it could be that the lack of housing for the people that serve those visitors ends up creating that limit ."

Chinese national Xia Boyu reached the summit at 8 : 26 am Nepal time , according to a post by his son Cloud Xia on the Chinese messaging platform WeChat. My Dad reached Everest at 8 : 26 Nepal time ! ! ! Has realized his 40 years dream ! ! !  Cloud Xia wrote. Xia senior lost both of his legs below the knee amputated after suffering frostbite in a failed Everest expedition when he was just 25. He is now reportedly descending the mountain. He is being guided by Mingma G. Sherpa , a veteran Nepalese mountaineer , who successfully climbed the world  s 14 highest mountains on first attempt. An additional 11 Sherpas are providing support. Xia Boyu , a 69 year-old double amputee from China , sitting in his hotel room in Kathmandu prior to his fifth attempt to summit Mount Everest , on April 4 , 2018. Casey Quackenbush  TIME I love the mountain ,  Xia told TIME prior to his climb , I will fight for it my entire life.  Xia  s success casts fresh light on the Nepalese government  s failed attempt to ban certain groups of climbers from the mountain. In an effort to improve safety , and to halt overcrowding on Everest , the government last December issued a ban on climbers who are disabled , blind , below the age of 16 , or intending to climb solo. An outcry ensued , and Hari Budha Magar , a former Royal Gurkha Rifles soldier and a double amputee , launched a legal action , citing a violation of the United Nations  convention. In response , the Supreme Court put the ban under temporary review , creating a window for Xia to make his attempt. Xia lost his legs after his first attempt on Everest in 1975 , when he was part of the Chinese Mountaineering Team , after he lent a teammate his sleeping bag. He previously attempted Everest in 2014 , 2015 , and 2016. In 2014 , climbing season was cancelled due to an avalanche. His attempt in 2015 was also cancelled following a 7.8 earthquake that shook Nepal and triggered more avalanches on the mountain. In 2016 , Xia got to within 300 feet of the summit when a blizzard forced him to retreat. New Zealander climber Mark Inglis was the first double amputee to ever summit Everest from the Tibet side in 2006. Santiago Quintero , a climber from Ecuador who is missing parts of both his feet and listed as a double amputee in the Himalayan Database , summited from the Nepal side in 2013. In 2017 , Jeff Glasbrenner , an American single amputee , summited in 2017. Over 500 climbers from 38 different expeditions are attempting Everest this season , according to the Himalayan Times.

The case was investigated by the United States Department of Homeland Security  Office of Inspector General ( DHS-OIG ) and the West Virginia Commission on Special Investigations. Pamela Taylor , 57 , admitted that she falsely registered for Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) disaster benefits after the June 2016 flood in Clay County , West Virginia. Taylor claimed that her primary residence was damaged by the flood and that she was staying in a rental unit after the flood. In fact , her primary residence was undamaged , and she still resided there. Due to her false statements , she received more than $ 18,000 in FEMA benefits to which she was not entitled. In her plea agreement , Taylor agreed to pay restitution of $ 18,149.04. The flood was a natural disaster. Stealing from FEMA is a manmade disaster ,  said United States Attorney Mike Stuart. The floods of June 2016 were historic and devastating to thousands of West Virginians. Lives were lost. Too many of our brothers and sisters lost everything. FEMA dollars are critical but limited. Stealing critical FEMA dollars is a crime  literally and figuratively. Taylor  s fraud scheme diverted disaster benefits from our most desperate and vulnerable , those most in need of help. We take the solemn responsibility of ensuring FEMA dollars are used responsibly and legally. The public can rest assured that my office takes heinous acts like stealing from disaster relief funds very seriously and will prosecute each and every case brought to us to the maximum extent of the law.  Taking advantage of federal funds intended for disaster relief misappropriates taxpayer dollars , reduces monies available to true victims , and erodes public confidence in relief programs ,  said Special Agent in Charge Mark Tasky of DHS-OIG. In July 2016 , after the good people of West Virginia were devastated by severe storms , flooding , landslides , and mudslides the month prior , the Defendant knowingly submitted a fraudulent application for disaster relief , in order to enrich herself and divert critical funds away from true disaster victims. The DHS-OIG , operating jointly with our partners in the West Virginia Commission on Special Investigations and the United States Attorney  s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia , worked tirelessly to bring the Defendant to justice for her crimes.  Taylor faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 500,000 when she is sentenced on May 30 , 2019. United States District Court Judge the Honorable Irene C. Berger presided over the plea hearing. Assistant United States Attorneys Stefan Hasselblad and Meredith George Thomas handled the prosecution.

It was one of the largest wildfires in California history Power lines owned by Southern California Edison sparked the Thomas Fire , according to a report released Wednesday by the Ventura County Fire Department. The origin of the fire was on private property near 16840 Anlauf Canyon Road. It started about 6 : 20 p.m. Dec. 4 , 2017 , about a half a mile into a canyon on a cattle ranch , according to the report. Those flames went on to merge with a separate fire reported an hour later in the area of Koenigstein Road and Highway 150 , the report states. Based on witnesses  statements , video evidence and Edison equipment retrieved from the Anlauf Canyon origin area , investigators have determined power lines owned by the utility arced and made contact with each other in high winds. This caused molten aluminum particles  to fall to the ground , where dry vegetation caught fire , the report states. Ventura County wildfire coverage : In a news release Wednesday , Edison said it has fully cooperated with fire officials throughout the investigation but said its own findings about the Anlauf Canyon fire suggest there could be another cause. Edison said it obtained evidence through publicly available radar data that suggests a smoke plume was forming in the canyon prior to the first 911 calls. SCE provided this evidence to Cal Fire and VCFD investigators ; however , the report does not suggest this evidence was considered ,  Edison said. SCE believes the Anlauf Canyon ignition may have been independently responsible for a significant portion of the Thomas Fire damages. SCE also is not aware of any basis for criminal liability.  Edison previously has said it believes its equipment was associated with the ignition point on Koenigstein Road. On Wednesday , the company said a specific cause for that ignition point cannot be determined until its own investigators can analyze equipment and other evidence that may be in Cal Fire  s possession. Over 40 days , the Thomas Fire scorched 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties on its way to taking the second spot on Cal Fire  s list of largest California wildfires. For a time , it was the state  s biggest officially recorded fire until it was unseated by the Mendocino Complex Fire in summer 2018. The Thomas Fire destroyed 1,063 structures  many of them homes  as it encroached on Ventura , Santa Paula , Fillmore and the Ojai Valley. It claimed the life of Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson , 32 , as he battled flare-ups above Fillmore on Dec. 14 , 2017. A week earlier , Virginia Pesola , 70 , of Santa Paula had been found dead at the scene of a car crash on Wheeler Canyon Road within a mandatory evacuation zone. Hundreds of plaintiffs have named Edison and its parent company Edison International in dozens of lawsuits alleging the companies  negligence was to blame for the Thomas Fire. These lawsuits also contend the companies are liable for damages to victims of the Montecito mudslides on Jan. 9 , 2018 , a disaster they allege would not have happened if the hillsides had not been left barren by the Thomas Fire. Edison said any investigative findings don  t provide a final resolution as to cause or responsibility. The courts will make the final determination. However , Alexander Robertson , a Westlake Village-based attorney representing fire and mudslide victims , said the report  s conclusion is strong evidence of Edison  s alleged liability. The release of the report also means the case against Edison will be kicked into high gear. But this is a very , very good day for all of the Thomas Fire victims. It  s a big step forward to them getting some justice here and one step closer to getting some resolution in this case ,  Robertson said. Were crimes violated ? The beginning of the report lists different criminal violations , including involuntary manslaughter and unlawfully starting a fire. Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said he didn  t know why those were listed but said the report  s purpose is not to recommend charges but to provide a factual understanding of what happened.  According to court documents from the Thomas Fire litigation , the state Attorney General  s Office had been reviewing the investigative file. County fire investigators first sent it to the Ventura County District Attorney  s Office , which passed it along to state prosecutors due to a possible conflict of interest. It ' s unclear what the outcome of that review was. Lorenzen said it  s not normal for state prosecutors to review a fire investigation but said the Thomas Fire was not a normal fire. The number of structures lost and the rate at which the flames spread were abnormal , he said. MORE : California officials focus on forest management after fires The cause , however , wasn  t so out of the ordinary , Lorenzen said. A majority of our wildland fires are caused by faulty equipment , so I  m not surprised ,  he said.  The sentiment was shared among some of the hundreds of residents who lost their homes , belongings and memories to the flames of the fire that was spread by Santa Ana winds. That  s kind of what we were expecting to hear.  It sounds like they did a very thorough job ,  said Dylan Chappell , who relocated to the RiverPark neighborhood of Oxnard after losing his home in Ventura  s Ondulando neighborhood. Chappell , 39 , is in the process of rebuilding his house , a feat he said has been an exercise in patience.  The report does lend itself to some kind of closure for him. What about Edison  s evidence ? Time-stamped video evidence from the night of the fire shows lights consistent with arc flashes at 6 : 17 p.m. Those flashes match up with a blip Edison reported in its system at 6 : 17 p.m. , according to the report. Edison representatives told The Star they were investigating the blip but did not know what caused it. But as their own team investigated the blaze , they turned up evidence of a smoke plume forming in the Anlauf Canyon area prior to the blip , they said. The company hired an atmospheric scientist to analyze data from a National Weather Service radar tower in the Sulphur Mountain area to investigate the development of the fire. The scientist created a simulation of the fire  s smoke plume based on the size and shape of the material the radar waves caught. The size and shape were consistent with wildfire ash measurements , Edison representatives said. MORE : California considers insurance to help with wildfire costs The scientist found that the first time these particles appeared to be spatially and temporally consistent with a wildfire ash plume was 6 : 07 p.m. in the Anlauf Canyon area , Edison representatives said. According to the scientist  s calculations , it would have taken the smoke a minute and a half to 2 minutes to rise the 1,600 to 1,800 feet to be picked up on radar. The scientist  s findings suggest this means the plume likely would have been there about 6 : 05 p.m. , Edison representatives said. In the news release , Edison also claims the Ventura County Fire Department failed to prevent the destruction of evidence critical to the fire investigation. This includes physical evidence near the fire  s origin and video footage , Edison said. SCE understands that Ventura County had approximately 12 cameras in the vicinity , but VCFD recently revealed it had failed to preserve video footage from 11 of those cameras ,  Edison said. Preventing future wildfires Edison said comprehensive policy changes are still needed to address the growing threat of wildfires and it supports measures that increase funding for fire suppression as well as mitigation efforts. The company points to legislation like Senate Bill 901 as a step in the right direction. That legislation requires utilities like Edison to file wildfire mitigation plans with the California Public Utilities Commission. Sharon Kerr , another Ventura resident whose home was lost , said she hopes the Thomas Fire report pointing at Edison can play a part in those policy changes. It feels to me a lot of Edison  s infrastructure is not the most up-to-date ,  Kerr said. I just hope things start changing now.  In an email to the Star , city of Ventura Fire Chief David Endaya said the release of the fire  s cause is an important step and provides the opportunity to learn and become better prepared for these hazards. Wildfires have become an unfortunate , yet likely , reality in California and many other states ,  Endaya wrote. Any lessons we are able to learn that will help prevent this type of event from happening again are extremely valuable and worth all of the time and effort put forth by such an experienced and dedicated investigation team.  Staff writer Jeremy Childs contributed to this report .|||||Investigators have determined that Southern California Edison power lines ignited the 2017 Thomas fire , a massive blaze in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties that killed two people and later gave rise to a massive mudflow that resulted in at least 21 deaths. Following a 15-month probe by Ventura County Fire Department investigators , along with teams from Cal Fire and the U.S. Forest Service , officials found the fire was started by two power lines that slapped together during high winds on the evening of Dec. 4 , 2017. A high wind event caused the power lines to come into contact with each other , creating an electrical arc ,  the Ventura County Fire Department said in a press statement Wednesday. The electrical arc deposited hot , burning or molten material onto the ground , in a receptive fuel bed , causing the fire. The common term for this situation is called line slap ,  and the power line in question is owned by Southern California Edison.  In October , the utility said its electrical equipment likely sparked at least one starting point in the massive fire , which burned 281,893 acres. The loss of vegetation in that area ultimately resulted in the collapse of hillsides north of Montecito during heavy rains on Jan. 9 , 2018. Advertisement In a statement released late Wednesday afternoon , Southern California Edison said it questioned the investigation report , and said the final resolution as to cause or responsibility  would have to be determined in court. Among other issues , SCE said investigators failed to preserve certain critical evidence  such as video surveillance footage  and suggested investigators failed to consider evidence that would limit their responsibility for the blaze. The investigators  finding would appear to put the utility on the hook for not only more than $ 1.3 billion in insurance claims filed by Thomas fire victims , but also for the $ 400 million in claims filed after the Montecito slides. Investigators have also forwarded their findings to the state attorney general  s office and said they believed the utility could face charges of involuntary manslaughter , unlawfully causing a fire causing great bodily injury and negligently maintaining their equipment. Such a finding could lead to steep fines and affect the company  s ability to win contracts , experts say. Attorney Joseph Liebman , who represents more than 500 plaintiffs suing the utility for its role in the Thomas fire and Montecito mudslide , said Wednesday  s findings confirm what he and his clients already knew about the utility  s role in disasters. As far as Edison is concerned , it  s game over as far as liability in the case ,  Liebman said. It  s not sufficient for the public utilities to complain about drought-changed conditions and/or climate change and do nothing. The reality is , if you  re going to be a responsible citizen and utility you have to take into account the times may be different and respond accordingly. That means upgrading your infrastructure and if you pass along the costs to the customers , so be it.  Although Southern California Edison had acknowledged its equipment likely started a fire off Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula , its own investigators concluded that the company was probably not responsible for a second , larger blaze that began in Anlauf Canyon earlier in the evening. The utility said it provided evidence to that effect to investigators , but there was no mention of that evidence in Wednesday  s report. SCE has evidence that the ignition at Anlauf Canyon started at least 12 minutes prior to any issue involving SCE  s system ,  the company said. SCE believes the Anlauf Canyon ignition may have been independently responsible for a significant portion of the Thomas Fire damages. SCE also is not aware of any basis for criminal liability.  In the report released Wednesday , investigators said the Thomas fire first began as two separate fires that joined together and burned for 40 days. They determined the utility was responsible for both ignitions. We understand the ramifications around releasing information and making statements in this official report.  It was very thorough ,  said Ventura County Fire Capt. Stan Ziegler. He said he was not aware of the evidence Edison said it had in its possession to dispute the findings. Southern California Edison officials have said they will work with insurance companies to handle the thousands of claims that have accumulated since the Thomas fire and mudflow. The company is protected from going bankrupt over the disasters , thanks to a law signed during the summer that passes excess liability costs on to utility customers. California  s largest utilities have fallen under increasing criticism over their role in a series of major wildfires. Last month , Pacific Gas and Electric said its equipment would probably be found responsible for igniting the deadly Camp fire in Butte County on Nov. 8 , 2018. PG&E equipment was also responsible for many of the wine country fires in 2017. The company has declared bankruptcy to help shield itself from a mountain of financial liability. In 2007 , San Diego Gas and Electric equipment caused the Witch fire that burned hundreds of homes and led to some 2,000 lawsuits. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars shoring up its grid to prevent a repeat of that disaster. Despite its own recent efforts to protect its power grid , Edison was recently accused of being responsible for November  s Woolsey fire that ripped through Malibu. The investigation into the cause of that fire remains ongoing. joseph.serna@latimes.com For breaking California news , follow @JosephSerna on Twitter .|||||What caused the Thomas Fire ? Report reveals what sparked one of California ' s largest wildfires CAMARILLO , Calif.  Power lines owned by Southern California Edison sparked the Thomas Fire , according to a report released Wednesday by the Ventura County Fire Department. According to the report , the blaze started in two spots and eventually merged into one fire. One was in a canyon above Steckel Park in the Santa Paula area and where first responders were sent when the blaze broke out at about 6 : 30 p.m. Dec. 4 , 2017. The second spot was on Koenigstein Road near Highway 150. Rumors swirled that equipment owned and operated by Southern California Edison was to blame for the blaze that spanned both Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.

More : Lawsuits allege Southern California Edison negligently started Thomas fire More : Thomas fire becomes California ' s largest wildfire in history The blaze began Dec. 4 , 2017 , as Santa Ana winds blew through the area. Over the next several weeks , as the gusts continued , flames scorched 281,893 acres and destroyed 1,063 structures  many of them homes in Ventura. Pesola , 70 , was fleeing the flames when her car crashed in a mandatory evacuation zone on Wheeler Canyon Road about two miles north of Foothill Road. Her burned body was found at the scene of the crash on Dec. 6 , 2017. About a week later , Iverson , 32 , died when he became trapped by flames while battling flare-ups above Fillmore on Dec. 14 , 2017. Although the official report had not yet been released , hundreds of plaintiffs named Edison and its parent company Edison International in lawsuits alleging the companies  negligence and liability in causing the blaze. Attorneys representing those homeowners , insurance companies , ranchers , and city and county entities expect the issuance of the report to cause more people to take legal action. The report also has a bearing on plaintiffs who have filed similar suits against the Los Angeles County-based utility company over the Montecito mudslides on Jan. 9 , 2018. The plaintiffs say the fire left the vegetation in the canyons above Montecito barren and the soil unable to hold water , which triggered a deadly debris flow during a brief but powerful storm. Edison has not previously commented on the allegations , citing the ongoing litigation and the lack of an official report by fire investigators. However , the company said in October that its equipment was associated with the Koenigstein Road ignition point.

In an ambitious move , the regional levee board of which Barry was a member filed the biggest environmental lawsuit in US history against the oil and gas companies that affected the wetlands. "" The reality is that our case is overwhelming , "" says Barry , adding that the companies "" violated the terms of their contract. They broke the law ! "" Most of the companies had , in fact , used permits that demanded any environmental damage be repaired. But the state legislature  which critics say is deeply influenced by oil-and-gas  argued that no laws had been broken , and passed a bill that crippled or perhaps killed the lawsuit before it reached a courtroom. Gov. Bobby Jindal then signed the bill into law. Barry has started a nonprofit to keep the suit alive , and tells the Times-Picayune that "" it really comes down to is the most basic conservative American values. It  s keep your word , obey the law , and take responsibility for your actions.

ATF agents joined city and state fire examiners probing charred remains at 1407 Constantinople St. , where campaign finance chief Mario Zervigon helped eight people , including his wife and two children , escape their burning home at 2 : 27 a.m. "" The ATF arson investigator has determined this is an arson , "" said Special Agent Kevin Moran of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives. Witnesses reported hearing glass breaking moments before two vehicles belonging to Zervigon were seen ablaze. One of the vehicles , a Honda Odyssey , was parked across the street from the house. Flames from the other , a Ford Explorer parked in a driveway behind the home , quickly climbed the back wall to engulf much of the house and damage an adjacent property. Capt. Edwin Holmes , spokesman for the New Orleans Fire Department , said it took 10 responding units to bring the fire under control by 3 : 05 a.m. One of the 26 firefighters working the blaze had to be hospitalized for possible fatigue and his condition was not disclosed. As investigators from the ATF , Louisiana State Fire Marshal and NOFD scoured the scene for evidence , a strong odor of soot and accelerant filled the air on the tree-lined street , especially near the burned-out Odyssey van. Moran said material collected from the vehicles has been sent to an ATF lab in Atlanta for analysis. "" The origin of the fire is unknown at this time , "" the ATF spokesman said. "" The lab will work to determine if any accelerant was used and what type. It will be a few weeks before we can say what was found. "" Zervigon said he had received no threats and had no idea why his home and property would have been attacked. "" I don ' t know if anything is connected to anything I do , "" Zervigon said. "" But all I do is simple , basic fundraising and campaign work. "" Zervigon is the campaign finance director for Public Service Commission candidate Forest Wright , who this week advanced to a Dec. 6 runoff against incumbent Eric Skrmetta. In this campaign cycle , he also served as finance director and did fundraising work for the successful reelection campaign of Civil District Court Judge Bernadette D ' Souza. The son of the late civil rights figure Carlos Zervigon also has worked for the campaigns of New Orleans City Councilwoman Susan Guidry and state Sen. J.P. Morrell. Guidry stopped by Thursday to personally survey the damage and left shaking her head. "" This is shocking , "" Guidry said. The fire displaced eight people from the three apartments contained within the large divided house , a property owned by Zervigon ' s mother-in-law , Kelcy Patterson. Zervigon said he helped his wife , Katy Patterson , a teacher at Lusher Charter School , escape with their children , who are 8 and 6. He then ran upstairs to wake a married couple who escaped from the top floor , while two other roommates from the other top-floor apartment got out through their door facing Prytania Street. Five pets lived at the house , but only two escaped. Katy Patterson said three cats died in the fire.

"" Somebody came and set both cars on fire. ... Why would you think anything like this would ever happen in New Orleans ? "" Casi Walgenbach and Chris McCarty , neighbors who live across Prytania Street , said they awoke to loud popping noises and screams , and saw Zervigon ' s two vehicles already burning before flames began showing from the roof of the house. "" We knew right away it was purposeful , because it was two separate fires on opposite sides of the street , "" Walgenbach said. "" It must ' ve been like a car bomb. I ' ve never seen anything like it in my life. "" Another neighbor , who declined to give her name , said residents gathered outside as firefighters arrived to battle the blaze. "" Two neighbors said they heard glass break right before the fire , "" she said. "" They said it sounded like two windows breaking at about the same time. It ' s awful. "" Zervigon said his family ' s house and possessions appeared to be a total loss. "" People have been calling to see what I need , "" he said. "" Like , ' Do you need a TV? ' "" He shrugged and laughed forlornly. "" Where am I going to put it ? "" he asked. "" I don ' t have a house. "" The only positive , he said , was that all tenants of the house escaped unharmed , but only just. "" The people who live upstairs barely got out of the house , "" Zervigon said. "" I ' m still trying to wrap my head around it all. "" I don ' t know if I was targeted. I don ' t know what ' s what. It ' s just a shock , "" he said. "" I think whatever idiot did it didn ' t realize they were going to catch our house on fire. It seems like if they wanted to catch our house on fire , they would have lit our house on fire. "" Because the house was subdivided into three apartments , it is considered a commercial building , making the ATF the lead agency on the investigation , Moran said. Agents already were busy collecting physical evidence , but also working to recover surveillance video from neighborhood cameras that could help develop a suspect or suspects in the case. ************* Note : The original version of this story was updated Thursday afternoon with additional information provided by the ATF ."
117,"A young child died yesterday in an accidental shooting in Houston. Codrick Beal , 4 , had spent the night with a babysitter and family friend while his mother celebrated her birthday , when he got hold of a loaded firearm in the house yesterday morning and fatally shot himself , reports the Houston Chronicle. "" My baby is gone , "" Codrick ' s mother , Ashley Beal , lamented outside the house. The babysitter , meanwhile , fell to the ground convulsing as she sobbed outside her home ; paramedics later returned to pick her up. "" It ' s just a terrible accident , "" a cousin of Codrick ' s mom tells the Chronicle. "" We see it all the time on the news but you never think it ' ll hit home. It ' s the most horrible thing. "" story continues below Investigators are still trying to determine how the boy got hold of the weapon , reports ABC 13. An average of 62 kids under the age of 14 die every year in accidental shootings in the US , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , though other figures suggest these numbers too low. Authorities did not divulge what type of gun was fired , to whom it was registered , or where Codrick died. ( Last year , a 3-year-old accidentally shot his 18-month-old brother to death in Arizona. )|||||Child &amp; Consumer Safety Child Access Prevention BROWSE STATE LAWS SHARE Comprehensive child access prevention laws are an incredibly effective tool to curb gun deaths and injuries among children and teens. Guns in homes pose a clear safety risk , particularly to children. When household guns are not stored safely or securely , the risk of death or injury only increases. Child access prevention laws hold gun owners accountable for the safe storage of firearms , imposing liability for failing to take simple yet important measures to prevent guns from falling into young hands. Background Easy access to firearms in the home results in high rates of unintentional gun deaths among children , youth suicides , and school shootings. Child access prevention ( CAP ) laws are an important tool for reducing these child gun deaths. CAP laws encourage the safe storage of firearms by imposing liability on adults who allow children to have unsupervised access to guns. 4.6 million minors in the US live in homes with at least one loaded , unlocked firearm. Many children know where their parents keep their guns and have accessed household guns  even if their parents think otherwise. Although 70 % of parents reported that adolescents could not independently access firearms in their household , over one-third of children belonging to those households reported being able to access the firearm in less than five minutes. Many of these children handled guns without the knowledge of their parents. Nearly a quarter of parents did not know that their children had handled a gun in their house. Household guns , often the most easily accessible firearms for youth , are a major source of weapons used in school shootings , youth suicides , and unintentional shooting deaths among children. Studies show that between 70 and 90 % of guns used in youth suicides , unintentional shootings among children , and school shootings perpetrated by shooters under the age of 18 are acquired from the home or the homes of relatives or friends. Several studies have shown that the risk of suicide and unintentional shootings among youth increases in homes where guns are kept loaded and/or unlocked. Safe firearm storage helps prevent gun deaths and injuries in children , and research suggests that CAP laws increase safe storage behavior. This makes CAP laws incredibly effective at preventing gun deaths and injuries among children and teens. Estimates suggest that modest increases in the number of American homes safely storing firearms could prevent almost a third of youth gun deaths due to suicide and unintentional firearm injury. Numerous studies over the past 20 years have found that child access prevention laws can reduce suicide and unintentional gun deaths and injuries among children and teens by up to 54 % , with the greatest reductions occurring in states which require safe storage of firearms. Summary of Federal Law There are no CAP laws at the federal level , and federal law does not generally require gun owners to safely store their guns. Federal law does , however , make it unlawful for any licensed importer , manufacturer or dealer to sell or transfer any handgun unless the transferee is provided with a secure gun storage or safety device ,  and immunizes the lawful owner of a handgun who uses a secure gun storage or safety device from certain civil actions based on the criminal or unlawful misuse of the handgun by a third party. For further details , see our summary on Safe Storage. Federal and state laws imposing a minimum age for the purchase and possession of firearms are discussed in our summary on the Minimum Age to Purchase and Possess Firearms. Summary of State Law CAP laws take a variety of forms. The strongest laws impose criminal liability when a minor is likely to gain access to a negligently stored firearm regardless of whether the minor actually gains access ( California ) . The weakest merely prohibit certain persons , such as parents or guardians , from directly providing a firearm to a minor ( Georgia ) . There is a wide range of laws that fall somewhere between these extremes , including laws that impose criminal liability for negligently stored firearms , but only where the child uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury. Weaker laws impose penalties only in the event of reckless , knowing or intentional conduct by the adult. State CAP laws also differ on the definition of minor.  States with CAP Laws California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New York North Carolina Oklahoma Rhode Island Tennessee Texas Utah* Virginia Washington Wisconsin * Utah  s law generally does not make adults liable for making firearms accessible to minors but for failing to remove firearms from minors who have violated minimum age laws.

Laws Imposing Criminal Liability for Negligent Storage of a Firearm Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have laws that impose criminal liability on persons who negligently store firearms , where minors could or do gain access to the firearm. Typically , these laws apply whenever the person knows or reasonably should know  that a child is likely to gain access to the firearm. States with Negligent Storage CAP Laws California Colorado ( also has a knowing , intentional , and reckless based law with a stronger penalty ) Connecticut Delaware* District of Columbia Florida Hawaii Illinois Iowa Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New York North Carolina Rhode Island Texas Washington *Delaware  s law has a criminal negligence  standard There are a number of variations in these types of laws , including whether the child must use the firearm , and whether the firearm must be loaded. The most significant variations are described below : States Imposing Criminal Liability When a Child Could or Does Gain Access to a Firearm The broadest laws apply regardless of whether the child even gains possession of the firearm. California , Colorado , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nevada , and the District of Columbia impose criminal liability in circumstances where a child may ( Colorado , Massachusetts and Nevada ) or is likely to ( California , Minnesota , New York , District of Columbia ) gain access to a firearm. The laws in Hawaii , Maryland , New Jersey , and Texas apply whenever a child gains access to an improperly stored firearm. In these states , it is not necessary for the child to actually use the firearm or cause any injury. States Imposing Criminal Liability When a Child May  or Is Likely To  Gain Access to the Firearm California Colorado District of Columbia Massachusetts Minnesota Nevada New York States Imposing Criminal Liability for Allowing a Child to Gain Access to the Firearm , Regardless of Whether the Child Uses the Firearm or Causes Injury California Colorado District of Columbia Delaware Hawaii Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Nevada New Jersey New York Texas States Imposing Criminal Liability Only if the Child Uses or Carries the Firearm Eight states require that the child carry or use the firearm in some way before criminal liability attaches. In Connecticut , Illinois , Iowa , North Carolina , and Rhode Island , the statute applies when the child uses the firearm to cause death or serious injury. Iowa , Florida , Maine , New Hampshire , and North Carolina also impose criminal liability when the minor takes the firearm to a public place , and/or uses the firearm in a threatening manner. The Maine , New Hampshire , and North Carolina statutes also impose criminal liability when the child uses the firearm in the commission of a crime. Connecticut Florida Illinois Iowa Maine New Hampshire North Carolina Rhode Island Washington States Imposing Criminal Liability for the Negligent Storage of Unloaded Firearms California Colorado Connecticut District of Columbia Hawaii Massachusetts Nevada New York California , Colorado , Connecticut , Hawaii , Massachusetts , Nevada , New York and the District of Columbia impose criminal liability even if the firearm is unloaded. All other states only impose criminal liability if the firearm is loaded. Common Exceptions States allow several exceptions to their child access prevention laws. Common exceptions to these laws include : When the firearm is stored in a locked container ( California , Colorado , Connecticut , District of Columbia , Florida , Hawaii , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Minnesota , New Hampshire , New Jersey , North Carolina , Rhode Island , Texas , and Washington ) . Rhode Island , Texas , and Washington ) . When the minor gains access to the firearm via illegal entry of the premises ( California , Connecticut , District of Columbia , Florida , Hawaii , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , New Hampshire , New Jersey , North Carolina , Rhode Island , Texas , and Washington ) . When the firearm is used for hunting , sport shooting or agricultural purposes. When the minor uses the gun in defense of self or others ( Colorado ) . When the firearm is used to aid law enforcement. When the child has completed a firearm safety course. Laws Imposing Criminal Liability for Reckless Storage of a Firearm As with laws imposing criminal liability for the negligent storage of firearms , laws which impose liability for the reckless storage of firearms vary in strength. Delaware criminalizes the reckless storage of a firearm only if a person prohibited from possessing firearms obtains said firearm. Delaware has a separate CAP law with a criminal negligence standard listed above. Virginia criminalizes the recklessly leaving a loaded , unsecured , firearm in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any child under the age of fourteen.  Wisconsin criminalizes the reckless storage of a firearm only if a child accesses the gun and either carries it in public or injures someone with it. States Preventing Persons from Intentionally , Knowingly , and/or Recklessly Providing Firearms to Minors Several states impose a weaker standard for criminal liability with regards to minor  s access to firearms. These states only prohibit persons from intentionally , knowingly , and/or recklessly providing some or all firearms to children ( these laws exclude negligence , which is the lowest threshold for liability ) . Colorado ( also has a negligence-based law with a lesser penalty ) Georgia Indiana Kentucky Mississippi Missouri Nevada ( this state also has a negligent storage law ) Oklahoma ( only in certain circumstances ) Tennessee Utah ( only in certain circumstances ) All firearms : Indiana , Missouri , Nevada , Oklahoma , and Utah laws apply to all firearms. All loaded firearms : Wisconsin , and Virginia prohibit persons from providing loaded firearms to children. Handguns only : Colorado , Georgia , Kentucky , Mississippi , and Tennessee laws only prohibit providing handguns to minors. Lesser standard for parents or guardians : Georgia , Indiana , Kentucky , Oklahoma , and Tennessee impose a lesser standard on parents and guardians , providing that parents may be guilty for providing firearms to children only where they know of a substantial risk that the minor will use the firearm to commit a crime.

Our reports bring you the latest cutting-edge research and analysis about strategies to end our country  s gun violence crisis at every level. Learn More Definition of Minor  The age which triggers a state  s CAP law varies , ranging from children under 14 to those under 18. Under 18 : California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , District of Columbia , Georgia , Hawaii , Indiana , Kentucky , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Mississippi , Missouri , Nevada , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Tennessee , Utah , and Washington Under 17 : Texas Under 16 : Florida , Maine , Maryland , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , and Rhode Island Under 14 : Illinois , Iowa , Virginia , and Wisconsin States Requiring that All Firearms be Stored with a Locking Device in Place Massachusetts requires that all firearms be stored with locking devices in place to prevent accidental discharge. This type of law is another important means to protect children from gaining unauthorized access to firearms and causing death or injury. Additional information about these kinds of laws is contained in our summary on Safe Storage. States Imposing Civil Liability on Persons Who Fail to Store Firearms Properly California imposes civil liability on the parent or guardian of a minor for damages resulting from the minor  s discharge of a firearm , where the parent or guardian permitted the minor to have the firearm or left it accessible to the minor. Connecticut imposes strict liability in civil actions on persons who fail to store firearms securely , where a minor gains access and causes injury or death. 90 % of shootings by kids involve guns from home Up to 90 % of guns used by minors in suicides , unintentional shootings , and school shootings are found in the child  s home or the home of a relative. + Source Renee M.

In Illinois , when a minor under the age of 21 legally acquires a firearms license by obtaining the permission of a parent or guardian , that parent or guardian becomes liable for civil claims for damages resulting from the minor  s use of firearms or ammunition. In Nevada , a parent or guardian is jointly and severally liable with the minor for civil damages caused by permitting the minor to possess a firearm , where the parent or guardian knows that the minor has a propensity to commit violent acts or has been previously adjudicated delinquent or has been convicted of a criminal offense , or knows or has reason to know that the minor intends to use the firearm for an unlawful purpose. Key Legislative Elements The features listed below are intended to provide a framework from which policy options may be considered. A jurisdiction considering new legislation should consult with counsel. Criminal liability is imposed on persons who negligently store firearms under circumstances where minors could gain access to the firearm , regardless of whether the minor actually gains access to or uses the firearm ( California , Massachusetts , Minnesota , District of Columbia ) . Criminal liability is imposed on persons who negligently store firearms even when the firearm is unloaded ( California , Hawaii , Massachusetts , District of Columbia ) . Civil liability for damages resulting from the discharge of a firearm is imposed on persons who negligently store firearms when a minor gains access ( California ) . Minor  is defined as a child under the age of 18 for long guns ( Colorado , Delaware , Indiana , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Missouri , Nevada , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Utah ) , and a person under the age of 21 for handguns , for purposes of the CAP law. All firearms are required to be stored with a locking device in place ( Massachusetts ) ."

( NDOT photo ) A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck in remote western Nevada near Tonopah early Friday , damaging U.S. Highway 95 in several areas and causing its closure until early afternoon. The temblor , which was originally classified as magnitude 6.4 but later upgraded by the U.S. Geological Survey , was reported at 4 : 03 a.m. about 35 miles west of Tonopah , near Coaldale. The quake  s depth was estimated to be 4.7 miles. Four sections of U.S. 95 in Esmeralda , Mineral and Nye counties  including a half-mile section north of the U.S. Highway 6 junction in Tonopah  were damaged , forcing travelers to make lengthy detours before the highway was repaired and reopened at 2 : 05 p.m. , according to a statement from the Nevada Department of Transportation. The largest repair entailed a 9-foot-wide-by-40-foot-long pavement patch. Permanent repairs will be scheduled in the future , although it  s too early yet to determine the cost and timeline. Photos from Esmeralda County showed a crack several inches wide running through both lanes of the highway. Mineral County Sheriff  s Office dispatcher Jim Kenner said residents in the county got a good shaking. We  ve got a lot of calls from frightened residents , but none of them report any damage ,  he said. Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said the earthquake shook the northern portion of Nye and Esmeralda counties.  A cursory windshield survey discovered some broken windows in Tonopah ,  Wehrly said. Patrol officers were sent north due to a report of damage to Highway 95 and possible damage in Gabbs.  The sheriff  s office said it would provide additional updates if more damage is discovered. Nye County spokesman Arnold Knightly said that as of midmorning , there had been 23 magnitude 3 or higher aftershocks following the initial quake. One aftershock was listed as magnitude 5. Over the next week , there is a 4 percent chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than 6.5 ,  Knightly said. It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next week with 3 magnitudes or higher.  Knightly said Nye County government infrastructure was not damaged. There are reports of broken storefront glass , stress cracks on asphalt streets , loose hanging signs , items knocked off shelves and some minor lifting of sidewalks ,  Knightly said. Overall , everything appears to be sound at this point ; however , we have learned that other than obvious earthquake damage , some damage is discovered later.  He said there were no reports of significant damage in Gabbs , which is about 75 miles north of Tonopah. Groceries off the shelves in Tonopah Keith Hasty works at the Super 7 gas station on Main Street in Tonopah. He said the earthquake shook the store and rattled nerves but caused no major damage that he knew of. It really shook a lot of groceries off the shelves ,  Hasty said. He said he was working since midnight and , after the quake struck , local residents who frequented the store were all talking about the quake. We have a lot of locals coming in saying their TVs were shaking , they felt it ,  Hasty said. Tonopah resident Susan Jesionowski said she woke up to find her 120-year-old house shaking from the earthquake. I live in a house behind the post office and my whole house shaked , rattled and rolled ,  Jesionowski said. The whole entire house was just rolling. I had canned goods go everywhere.  Jesionowski is the manager of the Tonopah Motel in downtown Tonopah , but the motel is closed for renovations. A voice message on the phone line at the historic Mizpah Hotel in Tonopah early Friday also indicated the hotel was closed for renovations.

119,"CLEVELAND , Ohio - Monday  s earthquake just northeast of Cleveland was at least the sixth in Ohio in 2019 , but by far the most severe. Here are some facts and figures for Ohio earthquakes , with the help of information from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources : 200-plus There have been more than 200 earthquakes recorded in Ohio since 1776. Keep in mind , however , many earthquakes likely went undetected before extensive monitoring was established. 4.0 or above Monday  s earthquake , if confirmed as reported as a preliminary estimate by ODNR as 4.2 on the Richter scale , would be just the sixth in Ohio registering 4.0 or above since 1950 , according to records from ODNR  s Division of Geological Survey. The previous earthquakes of this magnitude were : 4.0 in Mahoning County on Dec. 31 , 2011. 4.5 in Ashtabula County on Sept. 25 , 1998. 4.5 in western Ohio  s Auglaize County on Jan. 26 , 2001. 4.5 in Ashtabula County on Jan. 26 , 2001. 4.96 in Lake County on Jan. 31 , 1986. This earthquake was felt in 11 states , the District of Columbia and southern Ontario. Earthquakes in 2019 At least six earthquakes have been centered in Ohio this year : There were nine Ohio earthquakes in 2018 and 11 in 2017 , according to ODNR. Did you feel the earthquake ? Tell us at this link|||||EASTLAKE , Ohio - An earthquake registering 4.2 was detected in Lake Erie , a half-mile north of Eastlake , shortly before 11 a.m. Monday , the Ohio Department of Natural Resources said. An ODNR spokesman said the first aftershock of 2.2 was detected eight minutes later at 10 : 58 a.m. Both recordings are considered preliminary , said Eric Heis , a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Little damage was reported. There were reports of houses shaking , and things such as books falling off shelves. ODNR initially reported the quake at 4.4 , then revised it down to a still preliminary 4.2. If confirmed at 4.2 , it would mark just the sixth Ohio earthquake of at least 4.0 since 1950. Also , the U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake at 4.0. Information from multiple seismic stations are taken into account , Heis said. The closest recording location to Monday  s earthquake is Lake Erie Bluffs seismic station , operated under a joint agreement between ODNR and the Lake Metroparks. Jeff Fox , a seismologist from the Ohio Geological Survey , said the earthquake was widely felt south toward Akron and Canton , north into Ontario , east into Ashtabula county and west to Sandusky. Fox said there were at least four aftershocks , ranging from 2.1 to 2.5 magnitude. Reaction was swift on social media , with reports of people feeling the earthquake mainly from throughout Lake County and parts of Cuyahoga County. Mapping by the U.S. Geological Survey showed reports of mostly light or no damage. The nearby Morton Salt mine in Fairport Harbor reported no problems but officials were taking precautions : "" Nothing is more important than the safety of our employees , so we are performing comprehensive inspections on the surface and underground to assess the potential impact of the earthquake to confirm it did not compromise the integrity of our operations ,  spokesman Paul Jackiewicz said. Did you feel the earthquake ? Tell us at this link Though earthquakes are infrequent in Ohio in comparison to other areas of the country , ODNR reports that there have been at least 200 earthquakes with epicenters in Ohio since 1776. Among those , at least 15 have caused at least minor damage. Generally , according to ODNR , an earthquake of 3.5 to 4.1 is felt by most people , with possible damage to windows. More , but small damage , normally can occur with earthquakes of 4.1 to 4.7. On Jan. 31 , 1986 , an earthquake in southern Lake County registered 4.96 on the Richter scale. It was felt in 11 states , the District of Columbia and southern Ontario. Plain Dealer reporters Mary Kilpatrick and Hannah Drown contributed to this report ."
120,"Police arrest former activist suspected of Arizona Democratic Party headquarters arson Phoenix police have arrested Matthew Egler , a Democratic activist who party officials say has had a long and troubled history with the Maricopa County Party over the years , for the fire that destroyed Arizona Democratic Party ' s headquarters last week. The fire ruined historical political memorabilia and party infrastructure ahead of Tuesday ' s primary election. After a nearly weeklong investigation , Phoenix police on Wednesday identified Egler , 29 , of Peoria , in connection with the fire set to the party ' s headquarters. The fire occurred after midnight on Friday , last week. In announcing the arrest , police released footage of a dark car parked near the north side of the building , and a person lighting the fire outside of the building. As the fire grows , the person walks back to the car. Egler appeared on Wednesday before a Maricopa County commissioner for his initial appearance. He is being held on $ 75,000 bail ; his arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 4  election day  according to the sheriff ' s office. ARREST MADE : 29-year-old Matthew Egler has been arrested in connection with the fire set to the Democratic Party Headquarters. The fire happened after midnight on Friday , July 24 near Central and Thomas in Downtown Phoenix. The fire caused substantial damage to the building. pic.twitter.com/6cXhOppySA  Phoenix Police ( @PhoenixPolice ) July 29 , 2020 Police announced the arrest on Twitter , saying only 29-year-old Matthew Egler has been arrested in connection with the fire. They did not immediately provide more details about what led to the arrest. In a document released by the Maricopa County Superior Court , police cited in a probable cause statement Egler ' s posts on social media admitting his involvement with the fire and his anger with the Maricopa County Democrats. He had been previously volunteering for the county Democrats , according to the probable cause statement , but had been banned from volunteering "" due to the nature of his previous behaviors. "" Egler reached out to the county Democrats about getting involved in his district , but was not allowed to volunteer. The Arizona Secretary of State ' s Office confirmed Wednesday he is still a registered Democrat. "" The defendant became upset with the Maricopa County Democrats for not allowing him to volunteer and in retaliation , deliberately set fire to the Maricopa County Democrats Office , "" the record said. Egler was arrested and booked on one count of arson of an occupied structure , a Class 2 felony , the second-highest felony. Police connected him to the crime after gathering video from surveillance cameras installed at the county party and nearby buildings. Police said in their probable cause statement that the video is of Egler , who had borrowed a family member ' s 2009 Pontiac Vibe to drive to the building to set the fire. He broke the building ' s glass doors and placed "" an unknown incendiary device inside of the building "" and "" lit it on fire. "" Democratic leaders in a joint statement said they were "" deeply saddened and shocked "" by the news. Arizona Democratic Party Chairwoman Felecia Rotellini and Maricopa County Democratic Party Chairman Steven Slugocki said the fire by one of their own would not distract them in November. "" As we work to navigate the process of finding a new home , we want to express our humble thanks and deep appreciation to all those who have reached out during this challenging time and have made generous donations , "" their statement said. "" We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. "" Tens of thousands of dollars have been donated to Democrats ' recovery fund. Asked for confirmation that the Secret Service was involved in the investigation into the Egler and the fire , a spokesperson responded to The Arizona Republic : The Secret Service is aware of this incident. As a matter of practice , the Secret Service does not confirm or comment on the absence or existence of specific investigations.  The fire last week came after at least one Democrat asked for help in 2017 to keep Egler away. Matthew Lewandowski , a former first vice chair of the Legislative District 22 Democrats , said he asked for a protective order in March 2017 from Peoria Municipal Court. He said Egler was harassing him. "" The bottom line that came out of it was I was denied because they said it was a First Amendment issue and a party issue that should be handled by the party , "" Lewandowski told The Arizona Republic. "" Talking with my wife and other people , I said it was a shame no one tried to look at the problem back then. "" A review of a Twitter account he maintains shows Egler , in recent days , posting videos of starting fires , complaining about local party leadership , and ultimately claiming that he "" bombed "" the office. In the hours before the fire , Egler was emailing state lawmakers making demands for an emergency session by Friday to change the dates of the elections because of an intimate relationship he claimed to have with Ivanka Trump and his assertion that he may be chosen as the GOP vice presidential nominee. Rep. T.J. Shope , a Coolidge Republican , said he forwarded the correspondence Wednesday to the state Department of Public Safety. Police arrest suspect in Democratic Party headquarters fire Police arrest Matthew Egler for Arizona Democratic Party headquarters fire Arizona Republic Egler served from 2016 to 2019 as a precinct committeeman in Legislative District 22 , which spans the northwest Valley , according to his own bio and party officials. He describes himself on LinkedIn as president of The Valley Leadership Council , described as non-profit intended to fight voter apathy. The council , according to public records , was formed in 2015 in Peoria as an educational non-profit and is not related to the well-known Valley Leadership civic organization. On his Twitter handle , @ValleyLeader , he says he is a Quasi dictator , first family , the King of chicago , and many other titles !  In the weeks and days leading up to the fire , he wrote and shared various posts about Ivanka Trump. For more stories that matter , subscribe to azcentral.com. On July 20 , days before the Maricopa County Democratic Party  s virtual convention , Egler posted a video of himself outdoors lighting on fire what appear to be voting guides. That  s all you can do , guys ,  he said. Light things on fire , here I go.  He lit the fliers on fire , saying , This is from the 2016 election , when I got rid of Joe Arpaio for the Latinos ,  he said of the former county sheriff who is running for re-election. Call the state legislature today for an emergency session.  Days after the fire , on July 26 , he began sharing local news accounts of the fire. Emojis accompanied several of the news stories and photos. In one video that appears to be taken on the outdoor patio of a home , he said it wasn  t very sad  that the building was bombed. He takes issue in rambling comments with the county party ' s chair , Steven Slugocki and state Party Chair Felecia Rotellini over unequal  distribution of donations and "" fixing "" the election for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said in the video his complaints were unheeded. Pretty sure Steven could understand why he  s bombed ,  Egler said in one video. If he doesn  t understand that , then I call the man a damn liar. I  m sorry that your donations that you  ve sent to Maricopa County Democratic Party as a result of that fire are being wasted.  On Tuesday , he posted along with a media account of the fire : I BOMBED THIS BUILDING DO YOU NOT SEE THAT ! ? ! ? ! I BOMBED IT ! ! ! !  A short time later , he posted I BOMBED THIS BUILDING LISTEN TO WHAT IM SAYING.  Egler was arrested last year by local police on suspicion of disorderly conduct and damage of property , according to public records. Charges were not filed in the case.

121,"A cellphone video of a Lethbridge , Alta. , police officer repeatedly running over an injured deer has emotions running high , with calls for criminal charges , reports of death threats against the officer and a flood of complaints to government agencies. In the video , published by Global News , an on-duty officer is seen using a police truck to drive over the deer multiple times in south Lethbridge , trying to kill it for nearly 15 minutes. The animal eventually died. "" I watch a lot of animal cruelty videos , unfortunately for my job , and this is among the worst that I ' ve ever seen , "" said Camille Labchuk , an animal rights lawyer with Animal Justice , noting it ' s a criminal offence to cause an animal unnecessary pain or suffering.

It ' s promising a full investigation that considers what happened before the recording , the circumstances surrounding the recording and what any other witnesses may have seen , among other evidence. Darrell Dalton , registrar of the Alberta Veterinary Medical Association , said he can ' t comment on whether this is a case of animal cruelty , without knowing the circumstances surrounding why the officer used his truck the way he did. "" It certainly does not meet the criteria for a humane death , "" Dalton said. "" It ' s not rapid , it ' s not painless and does not reduce distress and suffering.

So a train that barks like a dog isn ' t the strangest idea ever. A team at Japan ' s Railway Technical Research Institute has developed a system to keep deer safe and trains on time by turning to the sounds of the animal kingdom , according to Asahi Shimbun. Under the system , trains emit three seconds of the snorting noise deer make to warn each other of danger then 20 seconds of dogs barking as a "" deterrent noise.

With files from Blake Lough|||||The training and resources of the Lethbridge police officer seen repeatedly running over an injured deer on a city street are being called into question by a wildlife expert , who says a person should never , ever  euthanize an animal by running it over. Nigel Caulkett , a professor of veterinary anesthesiology at the University of Calgary , has over 30 years of experience researching the safe capture and handling of animals as well as the euthanasia of animals. He has focused much of his research on pain and pain management in deer. Caulkett said situations in which officials are called to dispatch an injured animal can be very stressful , but responding officers should be trained in humane ways to euthanize an animal in distress.

I sympathize with the officer somewhat because you do need the right tools to do your job ,  Caulkett said. I know there  s been some talk about ( how ) he should have used his service firearm. I  m not sure what they have in Lethbridge  if it  s a nine-milimetre or a .40 Smith and Wesson  but either of them at close range would do the job , but the bullets they use don  t necessarily stay in the animal , and I think there would have been a worry about human safety if the bullet exited or if the hit wasn  t appropriate and ricocheted the bullet.  Story continues below advertisement Caulkett said he  s been working with other wildlife management agencies to study a frangible bullet  which would enter the animal  s head and then break into fragments , instead of leaving the animal  s body  that could be used for animal euthanization , but officers would still need the proper training and resources to use that method.

In rare situations where an animal is really suffering and a responding officer doesn  t have proper resources , Caulkett said wildlife officials also recommend what  s called a quick kill ,  which involves a quick cut to the animal  s carotid and jugular arteries.

This has resulted in a disproportionate strain on both the resources of these agencies and their staff , who very much care about the treatment of animals.  What  s the proper response ? Caulkett said it  s his understanding that when responding to an incident involving injured wildlife , any officer is required to call Fish and Wildlife or another peace officer to get permission to euthanize the animal. There can be a lag phase , but the times I  ve had to do it  I  ve been able to obtain permission very quickly ,  he said.

He also could not confirm whether the responding officer called to ask for permission or guidance before killing the deer. He said running over an animal until it is dead is not part of the training Lethbridge officers receive and that ASIRT will be investigating the protocols the police force has in place as well as the officer  s actions.

Photo  Ministry of Agriculture , Mechanisation and Irrigation Development , Zimbabwe. 3 February 2017 , Harare  A fall armyworm outbreak , the first emergence of the pest in southern Africa , is causing considerable crop damage in some countries. If the pest damage aggravates , it could dampen prospects for good crop harvests that is anticipated in the current farming season. Maize , a staple food in the region has been the most affected , as well as other cereals including sorghum , millet and wheat. Southern Africa is reeling from the effects of two consecutive years of El Nino-induced drought that affected over 40 million people , reduced food availability by 15 percent and caused a cereal deficit of 9 million tonnes. The FAO Subregional Coordinator for southern Africa , David Phiri , said that the situation was constantly evolving. The situation remains fluid. Preliminary reports indicate possible presence ( of the pest ) in Malawi , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has positively identified the presence of the pest while the rest are expected to release test results soon , "" he said. In Zambia , the Government has already spent US$ 3 million in an attempt to control the pest that has affected approximately 130 000 hectares of crops. However , the full extent of the damage in the country and other affected countries , is yet to be established. The pest which primarily spreads through wind dispersal and host plant products , is reported to be still active. The affected countries are also in different stages of assessing the damage to the crops because the outbreaks did not occur simultaneously. Fall armyworm is a relatively new pest from the Americas , whose presence on the African continent was first reported in Sao Tome and Principe around January 2016. The pest is known to cause extensive crop losses of up to 73 percent depending on existing conditions and is difficult to control with a single type of pesticide , especially when it has reached an advanced larval development stage. Emergency Regional Meeting to shape coordinated action FAO , in partnership with the Southern African Development Committee ( SADC ) and the International Red Locust Control Organization for Central and Southern Africa ( IRLCO-CSA ) , is organizing an Emergency Regional Meeting of key stakeholders from 14 to 16 February 2017 in Harare , Zimbabwe. Southern Africa is currently facing serious threats posed by diverse transboundary pests and diseases , including the varied armyworms , locusts , the tomato leaf minor and maize lethal necrosis disease. The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza , H5N8 strain , that has been confirmed to be in Uganda and possibly Rwanda too , is likely to spread southwards , along the wild bird migration routes  , said David Phiri. The Harare meeting will discuss the strengthening of surveillance , preparedness and coordinated emergency responses to transboundary crop pests and livestock diseases , including the fall armyworm infestation. It will also discuss control strategies and measures and provide a platform for sharing experiences and valuable lessons. The meeting is being organized with funding availed to FAO by the Africa Solidarity Trust Fund , United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and the United Kingdom  s Department for International Development ( DFiD ) . Developing capacities for rapid response As the region faces up to these new and emerging challenges , that are threatening the livelihoods of over 70 percent of the population that depend on agriculture , there is a crucial need to enhance capacity at country and regional levels , to prevent , detect and respond rapidly to any new pests and diseases threat. The countries need to maintain and , where needed , expand diagnostic laboratory , surveillance and response capacity as well as conduct assessments and research to enable rapid responses to recurrent and new threats  , said David Phiri. FAO is working with governments , the SADC and other stakeholders to develop and roll out an appropriate strategy to determine the level of fall armyworm infestation and its impact on crop production. The organization will continue supporting response efforts as well as contribute to enhancing the resilience capacity of the countries and stakeholders in the region ."

Scientists are reporting that a wall of water up to nine meters ( 30 feet ) high surged onto Hawaiian shores about 500 years ago. A 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Aleutian Islands triggered the mighty wave , which left behind up to nine shipping containers worth of ocean sediment in a sinkhole on the island of Kauai. The tsunami was at least three times the size of a 1946 tsunami that was the most destructive in Hawaii  s recent history , according to the new study that examined deposits believed to have come from the extreme event and used models to show how it might have occurred. Tsunamis of this magnitude are rare events. An earthquake in the eastern Aleutian Trench big enough to generate a massive tsunami like the one in the study is expected to occur once every thousand years , meaning that there is a 0.1 percent chance of it happening in any given year  the same probability as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake that struck Japan , according to Gerard Fryer , a geophysicist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach , Hawaii. Nevertheless , the new research has prompted Honolulu officials to revise their tsunami evacuation maps to account for the possibility of an extreme tsunami hitting the county of nearly 1 million people. The new maps would more than double the area of evacuation in some locations , according to Fryer. You  re going to have great earthquakes on planet Earth , and you  re going to have great tsunamis ,  said Rhett Butler , a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and lead author of the new study published online in Geophysical Research Letters , a journal of the American Geophysical Union. People have to at least appreciate that the possibility is there.  Hawaiians have told stories about colossal tsunamis hitting the islands for generations , but possible evidence of these massive waves was only first detected in the late 1990s when David Burney , a paleoecologist at the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Kalaheo , was excavating the Makauwahi sinkhole , a collapsed limestone cave on the south shore of Kauai. Two meters ( six and a half feet ) below the surface he encountered a layer of sediment marked by coral fragments , mollusk shells and coarse beach sand that could only have come from the sea. But the mouth of the sinkhole was separated from the shore by 100 meters ( 328 feet ) of land and seven-meter ( 23-foot ) high walls. Burney speculated that the deposit could have been left by a massive tsunami , but he was unable to verify the claim. The deposits remained a mystery until the Tohoku earthquake hit Japan in 2011. It caused water to surge inland like a rapidly rising tide , reaching heights up to 39 meters ( 128 feet ) above the normal sea level. After that tsunami deluged the island nation , scientists began to question Hawaii  s current tsunami evacuation maps. The maps are based largely upon the 1946 tsunami , which followed a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in the Aleutian Islands and caused water to rise only two and a half meters ( 8 feet ) up the side of the Makauwahi sinkhole. [ The Japan earthquake ] was bigger than almost any seismologist thought possible ,  said Butler. Seeing [ on live TV ] the devastation it caused , I began to wonder , did we get it right in Hawaii ? Are our evacuation zones the correct size ?  To find out , the study  s authors used a wave model to predict how a tsunami would flood the Kauai coastline. They simulated earthquakes with magnitudes between 9.0 and 9.6 originating at different locations along the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone , a 3,400-kilometer ( 2,113-mile ) long ocean trench stretching along the southern coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands where the Pacific tectonic plate is slipping under the North American plate. The researchers found that the unique geometry of the eastern Aleutians would direct the largest post-earthquake tsunami energy directly toward the Hawaiian Islands. Inundation models showed that an earthquake with a magnitude greater than 9.0 in just the right spot could produce water levels on the shore that reached eight to nine meters ( 26 to 30 feet ) high , easily overtopping the Makauwahi sinkhole wall where the ocean deposits were found. The authors used radiocarbon-dated marine deposits from Sedanka Island off the coast of Alaska and along the west coasts of Canada and the United States dating back to the same time period as the Makauwahi deposit to show that all three sediments could have come from the same tsunami and provide some evidence that the event occurred , according to the study. [ The authors ] stitched together geological evidence , anthropological information as well as geophysical modeling to put together this story that is tantalizing for a geologist but it  s frightening for people in Hawaii ,  said Robert Witter , a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Anchorage , Alaska who was not involved in the study. According to Witter , it is possible that a massive tsunami hit Hawaii hundreds of years ago , based on the deposits found in the Kauai sinkhole , but he said it is difficult to determine if all three locations experienced the same event based on radiocarbon dating alone. Radiocarbon dating only gives scientists a rough estimate of the age of a deposit , he said. All three locations offer evidence of a great tsunami occurring between 350 and 575 years ago , but it is hard to know if it was the same tsunami or ones that occurred hundreds of years apart. An important next thing to do is to look for evidence for tsunamis elsewhere in the Hawaiian island chain ,  said Witter. Fryer , of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center , is confident that more evidence of the massive tsunami will be found , confirming that events of this magnitude have rocked the island chain in the not-so-distant past. I  ve seen the deposit ,  said Fryer , who was not involved in the study. I  m absolutely convinced it  s a tsunami , and it had to be a monster tsunami.  Fryer is so convinced that he has worked with the city and county of Honolulu to update their tsunami evacuation maps to include the possibility of a massive tsunami the size of the one detailed in the new study hitting the islands. The county hopes to have the new maps distributed to residents by the end of the year , he said. We prepared ourselves for the worst tsunami that  s likely to happen in one hundred years ,  Fryer said of the current tsunami evacuation maps based on the 1946 event. What hit Japan was a thousand-year event  and this scenario [ in the eastern Aleutians ] is a thousand year event.  ### The American Geophysical Union is dedicated to advancing the Earth and space sciences for the benefit of humanity through its scholarly publications , conferences , and outreach programs.

The volcano first erupted Wednesday , marking the first such activity in more than 42 years , billowing a huge ash cloud over the sparsely populated , mountainous area in southern Chile. Calbuco ' s second blast overnight was stronger and lasted longer A second , more powerful eruption hit around 1 a.m. Thursday , creating swarms of lightning storms. Stunning photos captured the phenomenon , known as dirty thunderstorms ,  which illuminated the night sky. The eruption rained down as much as 15 to 20 inches of ash in the nearby town of Ensenada , officials said , closing schools and canceling flights. Several surrounding towns , including Alerce , Colonia Rio Sur and Correntos , were also evacuated. About 7 p.m. local time , two earthquakes associated with fracturing of rock occurred.

125,"Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Gilles Muller shocked the tennis world by beating an in-form Rafael Nadal in the round of 16 at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships on Monday , defeating the two-time champion 6-3 , 6-4 , 3-6 , 4-6 , 15-13 to reach the quarter-finals. Nadal ' s enthralling run of form in 2017 came to a screeching halt due to a ferocious performance from his Luxembourger foe , who survived a tug-of-war that lasted four hours and 50 minutes to clinch just his second major quarter-final. Marin Cilic awaits Muller in the next round after he trounced Nadal ' s Spanish compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut , 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-2 , on Manic Monday. Nadal maintained his composure even after such an agonising defeat : Two left-handed contenders of this calibre were always going to make for an intriguing bout , and the pair lived up to expectations with a roller-coaster duel on Court No. 1. Nadal could have been forgiven for being caught somewhat off guard in the first set , where Muller ' s aggression from the serve and follow-up play kept things tight as the latter carved out an early a 3-2 advantage. That approach helped Muller notch the first ( and only ) break of the first set to lead 4-2 thanks to Nadal hitting the net on a stern return. Both players served out the remainder of their points to mark a surprisingly clean set for Muller , who ended a substantial Nadal streak , per tennis writer Jose Morgado : The ensuing second set was over in a flash , as during the opening seven games , the loser managed to get more than one point on the board only twice , a sign of how vital the service battle had become. Nadal avoided any unforced errors in the first set but changed for the worse in the second , as he surrendered four , per the IBM Slamtracker. One of those again happened to come at a potentially decisive moment , when his sliced return skidded into the net to seal another break in Muller ' s favour to lead 5-4 , although tennis reporter David Law wasn ' t all surprised : The Nadal that returned to play in the third set was different than the one witnessed up to that point in the match  or at the very least , Muller ' s defiance had considerably lessened during the interval. Nadal ' s trusty left hand helped him win to love in the opener and defend his own serve with relative ease while breaking Muller to lead 3-1 and then 4-1 , although Stuart Fraser of The Times indicated the odds were still against him : That three-game streak ignited a fire in Nadal that burned until the end of the third set , and it was the Spaniard who this time came away with the smash-and-grab , albeit not before Muller fended off two set points. One came under the impression Nadal was far more likely to snatch the win the longer their clash raged on , and again he picked his moments wisely in the fourth , breaking Muller in near-identical fashion to the previous set. While Nadal failed to concede more than one point in any of his five services games during the set , a double-fault from Muller in the fifth gave Nadal the opening he needed to put together a three-game spree once again. The 31-year-old drew level at two sets each after seemingly draining Muller of all fortitude on his return , but a steelier response emerged from Luxembourg ' s finest in the decider as Match of the Day ' s Gary Lineker hailed the favourite ' s revival : Despite shifting the momentum in his favour , Nadal continued to see resistance from a relentless Muller , whose serve gave him a major advantage in the short rallies , while his foe excelled in longer exchanges. Nadal ' s return handed Muller some trouble , and although the same couldn ' t always be said vice versa , the underdog nevertheless kept things level at 4-4 without having to face deuce in the fifth set until that point. The 6 ' 4 "" dark horse forced two match points out of his foe in the 10th game before Nadal responded with resolve to tie matters up at five games apiece. But it wasn ' t long before Muller was back on the baseline , and sure enough , he served to love for the second game in succession. The balance of the points meant the Spaniard would be under the screw for the remainder of their clash , per Ben Rothenberg of the New York Times : Muller continued to stand the test of an enemy who would overwhelm others but struggled to keep up with his serve. The dark horse clinched advantage before taking the game to lead , with aces still playing a factor in his rise , as tennis writer Christopher Clarey noted : But Nadal was even keeping up in that regard and boasted 20 aces to his opponent ' s 24 as they raged into the 14th game of their meeting  not to mention the second hour of their fifth set  before Muller gleaned the slightest of cushions at 8-7. The tug of war broke the four-hour mark as the pair dragged each other into a 20th game with Muller holding a 10-9 lead. At that point , Nadal had missed four break-point opportunities : The Wimbledon crowd rallied around Nadal with every point he claimed , capitalising on any Muller error to eventually draw 13-13. Muller had found at least some answer to Nadal ' s serve , and to an extent , vice versa. Muller showed great calm with a backhand to again go ahead at 14-13 , but his critical piece of composure came a game later , when he opened up two match points and watched Nadal ' s forehand sail long to settle the match. The left-handed Muller handed Nadal a tough draw in the fourth round , although Cilic will be a difficult foe to down in his own respect , particularly with Muller fresh off a match that lasted close to five hours. Nadal has not advanced past the round of 16 at Wimbledon since 2011 , when he lost in the finals to Novak Djokovic ."

They quickly engulfed the small Tasmanian fishing town of Dunally , and swept towards the home where Tim and Tammy Holmes were babysitting their five grandchildren. There was no escape. No way out. And so the family did the only thing left open to them : they ran for the water. This extraordinary photograph shows Tammy Holmes , second from left , clutching her two small grandchildren , two-year-old Charlotte Walker , left , and four-year-old Esther Walker.

"" I ended up having to run down through a wooded area on my own , where there was so much smoke and fire , I didn ' t know where I was. So I just kept running. There was a moment of fear that this could be very , very dangerous. But I managed to run through and get to the water ' s edge , which was a kind of a sanctuary. "" The photograph  taken with remarkable composure by Tim Holmes  is likely to become one of the defining images of a disaster that has seen wildfires sweep south-eastern Australia. The blazes are the result of a record-breaking heatwave and strong winds. Since last week they have destroyed thousands of hectares of land and numerous properties. Among them are the pottery , craft gallery and B&B where Holmes , born in Wales , had lived on Tasmania ' s picturesque eastern coast since 1988. Remarkably , nobody has been killed. Other photographs taken by Holmes show his grandchildren perched on the edge of the jetty. They are about to plunge in. He explained : "" We were relying on the jetty really. And the difficulty was , there was so much smoke and embers and there was only about probably 200 to 300 millimetres of air above the water. So we were all just heads , water up to our chins just trying to breathe. The atmosphere was so incredibly toxic.

He loaded in the children and his wife and then took the boat 200m out from the coast , where the air was more breathable. The fire rolled into Dunalley last Friday. It destroyed the local church , the school , the old hall and around 90 houses. The children ' s mother , Bonnie Walker , set off for a funeral just before the flames appeared. By the time she reached the highway the blaze had engulfed the entire area. "" The road closed behind me , "" she told ABC News. "" We just waited by the phone. We received a message at 3.30pm to say that mum and dad had evacuated , that they were surrounded by fire , and could we pray. So I braced myself to lose my children and my parents.

( Read more Germany stories. )|||||Stains are inconsistent , don ' t seem to come from a flat corpse ( Newser ) - The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion ; bloodstains on the linen shroud , which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb , form the image of a crucified man. But a new ...|||||The authenticity of the Shroud of Turin has been in question for centuries and scientific investigations over the last few decades have only seemed to muddle the debate. Is the revered cloth a miracle or an elaborate hoax ? Now , a study claims neutron emissions from an ancient earthquake that rocked Jerusalem could have created the iconic image , as well as messed up the radiocarbon levels that later suggested the shroud was a medieval forgery. But other scientists say this newly proposed premise leaves some major questions unanswered. The Shroud of Turin , which bears a faint image of a man ' s face and torso , is said to be the fabric that covered Jesus ' body after his crucifixion in A.D. 33. Though the Catholic Church doesn ' t have an official position on the cloth , the relic is visited by tens of thousands of worshippers at the Turin Cathedral in Italy each year. [ Religious Mysteries : 8 Alleged Relics of Jesus ] Carbon and quakes Radiocarbon dating tests conducted at three different labs in the 1980s indicated the cloth was less than 800 years old , produced in the Middle Ages , between approximately A.D. 1260 and 1390. The first records of the shroud begin to appear in medieval sources around the same time , which skeptics don ' t think is a coincidence. Those results were published in the journal Nature in 1989. But critics in favor of a much older date for the cloth have alleged that those researchers took a sample of fabric that was used to patch up the burial shroud in the medieval period , or that the fabric had been subjected to fires , contamination and other damaged that skewed the results. The new theory hinges on neutrons released by a devastating earthquake that hit Old Jerusalem around the same time that Jesus is believed to have died. [ Who Was Jesus , the Man ? ] All living things have the same ratio of stable carbon to radioactive carbon-14 , but after death , the radioactive carbon decays in a predictable pattern over time. That ' s why scientists can look at the carbon-14 concentration in organic archaeological materials like fabrics , bones and wood to estimate age. Carbon-14 is typically created when neutrons from cosmic rays collide with nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere ( though it can be unleashed by manmade nuclear reactions , too ) . The group of scientists , led by Alberto Carpinteri of the Politecnico di Torino in Italy , suspect high-frequency pressure waves generated in the Earth ' s crust during this earthquake could have produced significant neutron emissions. ( They simulated this by crushing very brittle rock specimens under a press machine. ) These neutron emissions could have interacted directly with nitrogen atoms in the linen fibers , inducing chemical reactions that created the distinctive face image on the shroud , the scientists say. The reactions also could have led to "" a wrong radiocarbon dating , "" which would explain the results of the 1989 experiments , Carpinteri said in a statement. Giulio Fanti , a professor of mechanical engineering at Padua University , published a book last year "" Il Mistero della Sindone , "" translated as "" The Mystery of the Shroud , "" ( Rizzoli , 2013 ) , arguing that his own analysis proves the shroud dates to Jesus ' lifetime. In an email , Fanti said he is not sure if a neutron emission is the only possible source responsible for creating the body image. ( His own theories include a corona discharge. ) However , he wrote that he is "" confident "" the 1980s radiocarbon dating "" furnished wrong results probably due to a neutron emission. "" Shaky science ? Even if it is theoretically possible for earthquake-generated neutrons to have caused this kind of reaction , the study doesn ' t address why this effect hasn ' t been seen elsewhere in the archaeological record , Gordon Cook , a professor of environmental geochemistry at the University of Glasgow , explained. "" It would have to be a really local effect not to be measurable elsewhere , "" Cook told Live Science. "" People have been measuring materials of that age for decades now and nobody has ever encountered this. "" Christopher Ramsey , director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit , had a similar issue with the findings. "" One question that would need to be addressed is why the material here is affected , but other archaeological and geological material in the ground is not , "" Ramsey wrote in an email. "" There are huge numbers of radiocarbon dates from the region for much older archaeological material , which certainly don ' t show this type of intense in-situ radiocarbon production ( and they would be much more sensitive to any such effects ) . "" Ramsey added that using radiocarbon dating to study objects from seismically active regions , such as regions like Japan , generally has not been problematic. It seems unlikely that the new study , published in the journal Meccanica , will settle any of the long-standing disputes about how and when the cloth was made , which depend largely on faith.

TRY LAW360 FREE FOR SEVEN DAYS|||||LuLaRoe , the popular women ' s clothing line touted by tens of thousands of consultants around the country , is the subject of two class-action lawsuits filed by sellers who said they were duped into spending money on inventory that could never be sold. The suits claim the company is a pyramid scheme that urges sellers to go into debt to purchase inventory. Initial start-up costs to sell LuLaRoe are around $ 5,000 but consultants were urged to spend much more with the promise that any unused inventory could be sent back to the company for free with a 100 percent refund. "" Consultants are instructed to keep around $ 20,000 worth of inventory on hand , and are inundated with the phrase ' buy more , sell more , ' "" one of the lawsuits said. "" These incentives mean new consultants are aggressively pressured to continue purchasing wholesale inventory even when the inventory they have is not selling , is unlikely to sell , or is piling up in their garage. "" When consultants could not afford to purchase inventory , defendants and their representatives encouraged them to borrow money , get loans , take out credit cards and some were even asked to sell their breast milk to attain funds to purchase inventory , "" plaintiffs claim. Additionally , consultants were in "" unknowingly recruited into defendants ' pyramid scheme through manipulation and misinformation. "" "" Recruits were told that the opportunity entailed "" part time work for full time pay. This was not the case , "" the suit claims. Another suit claims LuLaRoe misrepresented its refund policy , making it difficult if not impossible for consultants to receive their money back for unsold products. LuLaRoe offered 100 percent refunds on unsold items - a policy it now says was only temporary. Those wanting to return items now will receive up to 90 percent and the company will no longer cover the cost of shipping. Many times , however , consultants learned they would receive nothing for their returned items , the suit alleges. If LuLaRoe determines an item is nonrefundable , it does not return the item to the consultant but rather donates the items to charity , depriving consultants of "" both the product and any compensation for the product , "" according to one of the suits.

130,"Fueled by fierce winds , the Springs Fire consumed more than 12 square miles Thursday , threatening homes , stretching from the 101 Freeway to Pacific Coast Highway in Ventura County , and prompting warnings as firefighters battled a difficult blaze into night. Updated Article : Fire Burns Toward Malibu The fire had grown to 8,000 acres by just before 8 p.m. , when fire officials said the blaze had threatened some 2,000 homes. Pacific Coast Highway had been shut down for a nine-mile stretch. By 9 p.m. the still-growing wildfire has reached PCH at Sycamore Canyon Road , according to a Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department spokesman. Sycamore Canyon is in Point Mugu State Park , home to some of Southern California ' s only remaining native grasslands. At least one home -- in an isolated , wooded area -- burned on the southern flank of the fire , as seen below. More than 800 people were affected by evacuation orders , according to fire officials. The blaze quickly consumed brush and vegetation in the steep terrain of southern Ventura County , prompting panic among evacuated homeowners amid record-high temperatures and low humidity. The fire was expected to increase in size significantly , and was 10 percent contained as of about 6 : 30 p.m. Officials said they expected that figure to be revised in the morning as the fire continued to spread late into the night. Strong Santa Ana winds had died down at that time , but fire officials warned they could pick up and again fan flames. "" We have conditions that are very dramatic , very dangerous for firefighters. This fire is growing , "" said Tom Kruschke , an information officer with the Ventura County Fire Department. "" We are asking members of the public to be very aware -- this is very dangerous. This is still a moving fire. If you were asked to evacuate , it will be a while before you are allowed in. And if at one point you are uncomfortable , please leave the area. It ' s not safe to stay ,  Kruschke said. The fire department had issued a map of the fire ' s footprint and the evacuation zone , as shown below. The fire , which broke out at 6 : 34 a.m. Thursday , had jumped over of Potrero Road and was making its way south toward Pacific Coast Highway and coastal Point Mugu State Park in the late afternoon. At a news conference at 6 : 30 p.m. , Capt. Mike Lindbery of the Ventura County Fire Department said fire officials were trying to prevent the fire from reaching PCH after it stalled in canyons as Santa Ana winds died down. But the wind could pick up and push the blaze farther south , he said. "" We are not going to call this thing caught till we have a good line around it and that line can hold the conditions that are presenting at the time , "" he said. He predicted the region is in for a serious fire season. "" We ' re having Santa Ana events in May , "" Lindbery noted , referring to dry Southern California winds that come from inland toward the coast , usually in fall and winter. "" An event like this ... it hasn ' t happened in my career. "" The fire initially grew within six hours to more than 6,500 acres , or more than 10 square miles. It began in rugged terrain of the Conejo Grade , just south of the 101 Freeway ( map ) before spreading rapidly to the southwest , prompting road closures -- including PCH -- and evacuations. Send NBC4 Your Fire Photos : Send us pictures at isee@nbcla.com or through the NBC4 LA mobile app. Mandatory evacuation orders were in place as of 6 : 30 p.m. in Sycamore Canyon , La Jolla Canyon and Broome Ranch. Residents were being allowed back into homes that had been evacuated in the Camarillo Springs area and the Dos Vientos area of Newbury Park. Residents need identification to return to their homes , Sheriff ' s Department officials said. Sheriff ' s officials initially said an evacuation order was lifted for California State University , Channel Islands , but that was corrected at 7 : 45 p.m. and the university remained closed. Burning agricultural buildings near the university had prompted a smoke advisory from the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District , which warned residents to avoid smoke. Lindbery said firefighters were letting the potentially hazardous material burn because it was not safe to attack with firefighting resources. For those in the university area , Lindbery advised : "" Be mindful , watch out for fire equipement and stay out of the smoke. "" Just before 1 p.m. , the California Highway Patrol had closed a nine-mile stretch of PCH between Las Posas Road and Yerba Buena Road , which is essentially the Los Angeles County line ( map ) . The crucial coastal highway was reopened just before 3 p.m. , with the CHP recommending drivers stay alert while in the area. The roadway was again closed on the same stretch at about 8 p.m. Yerba Buena Road and Deer Creek Road were also closed. Firefighters were facing difficult conditions : high winds , hot temperatures and low humidity amid a mountain landscape. The National Weather Service had issued a red flag warning -- indicating high fire danger -- through 5 p.m. Friday. Conditions were expected to be similarly hot and dry on Friday , Lindbery said. "" We  re chasing it , but we can  t stay ahead of this -- it  s moving so fast , "" said Lindbery at midday Thursday. We haven  t seen anything like this in a while. We  ve had a couple of really slow summers. This one  s waking us up really quickly.  Camarillo resident Zeke Jaquez was among the first to call 911 , reporting what would become the Springs Fire. He was driving from his home to Los Angeles when he saw what he thought was a car on fire off the side of the 101 Freeway. We all called 911 ,  Jaquez said. It  s unbelievable. It  s this huge monster.  Others in the surrounding residential areas watched the rapidly spreading flames with concern , as seen in the AP Photo/Ventura County Star image below. Cal State Channel Islands issued an advisory Thursday afternoon stating the campus would remain closed Friday. A chemical fire in the area was extinguished with foam. Authorities said it was not immediately known how the blaze started. About 100 campers and a resident were evacuated from Point Mugu State Park as a precaution , the Associated Press reported. A group of 120 children and 30 adults who were at a Camp Hess Kramer near Sycamore Canyon and PCH were escorted from the park shortly before midnight , Ventura County Fire ' s Capt. Dave Wareham said. Schools in the area of the fire were also evacuated. The Red Cross has established evacuation centers at Calvary Community Chapel located at 380 Mobil Ave. in Camarillo and at Thousand Oaks Community Center at 2525 N. Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks. Public and private animal shelters in Camarillo , Simi Valley and Augora Hills have offered to house evacuated pets. The statewide California Emergency Management Agency said Thursday that it had activated two operations centers in response to the Springs Fire and the Summit Fire in Riverside County , which began Wednesday. Cal EMA had deployed 10 of its fire engines to the Springs Fire. The state agency also announced that Gov. Jerry Brown ' s request had been approved for two Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance grants to pay for fire response. More than 925 firefighters and law enforcement personnel , along with 96 fire engines , six helicopters , dozens of hand crews and three fixed-wing aircraft were called into service. Meanwhile , a 98-degree reading recorded in Camarillo -- next to the raging fire -- set a high temperature record for the date. The previous record of 94 degrees was set in 2004. A record was also set nearby in Oxnard at 92 degrees. Wind gusts reached 70 mph in some areas , according to the National Weather Service. Fixed-wing air tankers at one point were grounded due to weather conditions. In addition to the large Springs Fire and the Summit Fire , a 12-acre blaze in Jurupa Valley burned Thursday , destroying multiple structures. A small fire was reported at about 3 : 15 p.m. in Calabasas , not far to the east of the Spring Fire , in a wash at Meadow Creek Lane and Lost Hills Road ( map ) . Los Angeles County Fire Department officials said quickly had the blaze contained at a half-acre. In Northern California , a Tehama County fire spread to 2,000 acres Thursday , and at least three other fires of fewer than 150 acres burned elsewhere in the northern part of the state .|||||More than 400 firefighters worked to significantly contain a wildfire in Southern California yesterday , but warn that things may get worse before they get better.

132,"AUGUST 4 -- Wyclef Jean , who appears ready to announce his candidacy for Haiti  s presidency , owes the Internal Revenue Service more than $ 2.1 million , according to federal tax liens filed against the musician , The Smoking Gun has learned. In May , the IRS filed a $ 724,332 tax lien against Jean. Last July , the agency filed a $ 599,167 lien against the performer. And a $ 792,269 lien was lodged against Jean in July 2007. The liens cover taxes due on Jean  s individual 1040 returns for 2006 , 2007 and 2008. Copies of the liens , which were filed at the Bergen County clerk  s office in New Jersey , can be viewed at left. In 1998 , Jean -- whose given name is Nel Wyclef Jean -- purchased a $ 1.85 million home at 8 Cameron Road in Saddle River , where he lives with his wife Claudinette and their family. The three IRS liens were filed against Nel W. Jean at the Cameron Road address. Other records show that Jean , 37 , has previously been the subject of two smaller tax liens filed against him by the State of New Jersey and the New York State Tax Commission , both of which were eventually satisfied. Following the Haitian earthquake , TSG reported on Jean  s questionable handling of the finances of his charitable foundation. Along with filing tax returns years late , Jean used his foundation to pay himself and a business partner more than $ 410,000 for rent , production services , and Jean ' s appearance at a benefit concert. Though the Wyclef Jean Foundation had operated at a deficit and experienced cash flow problems , Jean actually paid himself and a partner ( his cousin Jerry Duplessis ) $ 65,000 in upfront rent payments for space at a Manhattan recording studio the duo owns. The prepaid 25 months worth of rent covered the foundation  s use of a caf table in the studio ' s kitchen. Jean  s foundation has received millions in donations since the Haiti tragedy , but it is unknown how the group has spent those funds.

133,"BERLIN -- Three women are under investigation in Germany for launching paper sky lanterns for the new year which apparently ignited a devastating fire that killed more than 30 animals at a zoo , officials said Thursday. The three local women -- a mother and her two daughters , ages 30 to 60 -- went to police in the western city of Krefeld on New Year ' s Day after authorities held a news conference about the blaze , criminal police chief Gerd Hoppmann said. The women are being investigated on suspicion of negligent arson , prosecutor Jens Frobel said. The offence can carry a prison sentence of up to five years. Many Germans welcome in the new year legally with fireworks at midnight. Sky lanterns , however , are both illegal and unusual in Germany. The mini hot-air balloons made of paper have been used in Asia for centuries. The fire started in a corner of the ape house ' s roof in the first minutes of the new year and spread rapidly. The zoo near the Dutch border says the ape house burned down and more than 30 animals -- including five orangutans , two gorillas , a chimpanzee and several monkeys -- were killed , as well as fruit bats and birds. The animals either burned to death or died from smoke inhalation , authorities said. Hoppmann said the women had ordered five sky lanterns on the internet and told authorities that they had believed they were legal in Germany. He added that there was nothing in the product description showing that they were banned. Hoppmann described the women as "" completely normal people who seemed very sensible , very responsible "" and said it was "" very courageous "" of them to come forward , saving authorities a tricky investigation. He added that they feared reprisals and authorities limited the details given about the suspects. Investigators believe that just one lantern started the blaze. They found the other four later , with handwritten good wishes for the new year attached. The destroyed ape house lacked fire detectors and sprinklers , which weren ' t required when it was built in the 1970s. The zoo said , however , that it had passed a regular fire protection check a few months ago. The building ' s roof had been renovated after a hailstorm a few years ago and plexiglass was added , Hoppmann said. He said while investigators were confident the sky lantern was to blame , they will look at other factors that may have contributed to the blaze , such as dry fallen leaves on the roof. Investigators plan to carry out tests to help find out why the blaze spread so quickly. Firefighters were only able to rescue two chimpanzees. The zoo said Thursday it was satisfied with their condition .|||||A fire at a zoo in western Germany in the first minutes of 2020 killed more than 30 animals , including apes , monkeys , bats and birds , authorities said. Police said the fire may have been caused by sky lanterns launched to celebrate the new year , the AP reports. Witnesses reported that they had seen the cylindrical paper lanterns with little fires inside flying in the night sky shortly after midnight near the Krefeld zoo , Gerd Hoppmann , the city ' s head of criminal police told reporters Wednesday , just before the zoo began to burn. Police and firefighters received the first emergency calls at 12 : 38am. The zoo near the Dutch border said that the ape house burned down and more than 30 animals , including five orangutans , two gorillas , a chimpanzee and several monkeys , as well as fruit bats and birds , were killed. Only two chimpanzees could be rescued , zoo director Wolfgang Dressen said. story continues below "" It ' s close to a miracle that Bally , a 40-year-old female chimpanzee , and Limbo , a younger male , survived this inferno , "" Dressen said , adding that many animal handlers were in shock at the devastation. "" We have to seriously work through the mourning process. This is an unfathomable tragedy. "" The zoo director also said many of the dead animals were close to extinction in the wild. Police said that the use of sky lanterns is illegal in Krefeld and most other parts of Germany and that their use is uncommon. Sky lanterns , sometimes called Chinese lanterns , are a sort of hot-air balloon made of paper. They have been used in Asia for celebratory events for centuries. Hoppmann said investigators found used lanterns on the ground that hadn ' t burned entirely. They were 13.4 inches long , made out of white paper with an opening at the bottom where a small fire would have been suspended. The fire heats the air inside , making them fly and shine at night. Hoppmann said some of the lanterns had handwritten notes on them. ( Read more zoo stories. )"
134,"With the heartbeat  bill going into effect as Texas law next month , a conservative group has created a website where individuals can anonymously name suspected violators of the law , such as Goody Procter or Giles Corey. Some Texans , however , are using the site to troll the group. Conservative group Texas Right to Life set up prolifewhistleblower.com , a website site that has a form where whistleblowers can write out details of the supposed violations , including doctors behind the alleged abortion , and even upload files to support their claim if they wish. Texas ' bill-to-be , which Gov. Greg Abbott signed back in May , is considered one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the country. Though the bill is set to go into law on September 1 , some are already using the site to submit fake tips. Many trolls are including photos of pornography , some in reference to animated characters like Shrek. The trolls are not only giving a headache to whoever has to go through the anonymous tips , but standing up for Texas women in the process. Once law , Senate Bill 8 dramatically limits legal access to abortions to two weeks after a missed menstrual cycle , which is early enough in a pregnancy that women may not even know they are pregnant. The law will also let private citizens sue those who provide abortions and anyone who helps a woman obtain an abortion after six weeks , even if they ' re outside the state of Texas. The buzz around the website comes just over a month after abortion providers and advocates sued Texas leaders to stop the law from going into effect as it interferes with a Texas woman ' s right to control her reproductive health. Kin Man Hui / Staff photographer In a tweet from August 23 , Texas Right to Life claims it would not contact whistleblowers , but would instead do the rest  once anonymous tips were received. The organization doesn  t clarify exactly what that means or what it would do with the information , but concerned Texans didn  t care to find out. Some Reddit users questioned the validity of the submissions not coming from trolls , for a multitude of reasons. People will use it to report ex-girlfriends , girls they don  t like ,  points out u/Dan-68. This has lots of potential for misuse as a form of revenge.  Can you imagine if you have a miscarriage , are very emotional , and your neighbor reports you ?  questions u/redtron3030. Others pointed out that the website is from a private group , not a governmental entity. This website has no affiliation with [ the ] Texas state government , these reports go to private parties ,  reminds u/D14BL0. What a massive invasion of privacy ,  says u/DrLipschitz69. Overall , however , many users simply stuck to trolling Texas Right to Life. I saw someone uploading Shrek porn to it all day ,  claims u/c0nkah. I ' m definitely sending in pictures of my menstrual cup dump outs when I get the opportunity in a couple weeks ,  admits u/cordial_carbonara.

One user , u/Mr_Prestonius , said that since the site is hosted through GoDaddy , it will have to abide by the company  s rules. One of those rules includes not collecting non-public or personally identifiable information  about another person without their written consent , meaning that all non-trolling submissions that include a real person  s information would not be allowed. A number of Reddit users , including u/Mr_Prestonius , said they have reported the website for violating this rule , and it may have resulted in the website giving error messages at times on Wednesday.

136,"Ah , the buzzing smartphone : It ' s a call , a tweet , a funny photo  or an earthquake ? Yep , scientists say crowd-sourced data may one day relay warnings about impending quakes that have already begun elsewhere , LiveScience reports. In a computer-model study led by the US Geological Survey , researchers found that smartphones could send information about quakes of magnitude 7 or greater , giving several seconds of warning to areas the quake hadn ' t yet reached. The phones would automatically detect a temblor with an app using GPS technology and transmit information some distance away. Information from fewer than 5,000 phones would be enough to send a helpful alert , Eureka Alert reports  giving people time to halt trains , stop surgeries , take cover , you name it. "" A few seconds can be enormously helpful , "" says lead author Sarah Minson. story continues below This could bolster early warning systems that already exist ( in Japan and Mexico , say ) or curb the need for such pricey projects : "" We have high hopes that this could make a huge impact , "" says Minson. Scientists are currently planning a pilot project in Chile with 250 smartphones , and will also work with the West Coast ' s $ 145 million ShakeAlert plan , which mixes seismometers with GPS data. One little problem : Phone manufacturers don ' t allow access to raw GPS data , so smartphones will have to be reprogrammed down the road for the system to work. And , of course , the system will have to work in the real world for the first time , the LA Times reports. "" I ' m a little skeptical it will work , "" says a San Diego scientist. "" I think a system like that would false-alarm more than they claim in the paper. "" ( See why the odds of a strong California earthquake have just gone up. )|||||Southern California was rattled Thursday by a magnitude 5.3 earthquake that struck near the Channel Islands. The quake was the strongest in Southern California in several years , jangling some nerves but causing no major damage because it occurred offshore in the Pacific Ocean and not on land. The quake did cause some minor landslides and earth movement on Santa Cruz Island , which was close to the epicenter , and rattled a bald eagle whose livestreamed reaction to the temblor went viral. A 5.3 could be damaging if it was right under our feet ,  said John Vidale , director of the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC. It  s right on the edge of being an earthquake that could be dangerous. It  s a reminder that we need to be ready in the future.  Advertisement The temblor occurred just before 12 : 30 p.m. and was centered south of Santa Cruz Island , about 90 miles west of downtown Los Angeles. It was felt as far away as Bakersfield , Palmdale and the city of Orange , according to witnesses and the U.S. Geological Survey. Earthquake early-warning system gave heads-up before 5.3 magnitude temblor hit L.A. area  The L.A. area feels an earthquake of this magnitude on average about once a year , Vidale said. There is a 1-in-20 chance that Thursday  s quake will lead to a larger one in the next few weeks , he said. But , more than likely , smaller aftershocks that may not even be felt will follow , he said. The quake was too small and too far away from the coast to trigger any tsunami concerns. It would never make a wave that you could see ,  Vidale said. ( Los Angeles Times ) But it was large enough to activate the state  s developing earthquake early-warning system. Vidale said he and colleagues at USC heard beeping 10 to 15 seconds before the quake  s shaking reached their campus. We all felt it pretty well. It was small and distinct ,  he said. We heard the warning go off and then we heard the shaking.  The early-warning system is under development by the USGS and is available only to a limited array of testers , but it is expected that more people will be eligible to test the system later this year. It works on a simple principle : The shaking from an earthquake travels at the speed of sound through rock  which is slower than the speed of today  s communications systems. For example , it would take more than a minute for a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that starts at the Salton Sea and travels up the state  s longest fault , the San Andreas , to shake Los Angeles , 150 miles away. An early-warning system would give L.A. residents crucial seconds , and perhaps even more than a minute , to prepare. It got a significant boost in the federal budget signed into law in March , defying an earlier proposal by President Trump to end federal funding for the program. As part of the $ 1.3-trillion budget bill approved by Congress and signed by Trump , officials approved $ 22.9 million for the project. That more than doubles the $ 10.2 million it got in the previous year  s budget. The USGS has said it planned to begin issuing limited public alerts from the system by the end of this year , as long as funding wasn  t cut. Southern California is one area where the network of seismic sensors is dense enough at present to begin early warnings. That was the first earthquake I  ve felt since I got access to the @EarlyWarningLab beta app. I had 34 seconds warning  enough time to drop , cover , and hold on , which I would have done if I knew shaking was going to be strong. pic.twitter.com/Bx4Sn2imUW  Alissa Walker ( @awalkerinLA ) April 5 , 2018 Earthquake that rattled L.A. area was strongest in years  The temblor was located near the East Santa Cruz Basin fault zone , said Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson , and seismologist Lucy Jones said on Twitter that the fault system moves Southern California around a bend of the San Andreas fault.  Earthquakes happen out there now and again. There  s a major offshore fault system ,  Hauksson said. When asked why some people felt the earthquake but others nearby didn  t , Hauksson said where a person is matters a lot. People in high rises probably felt it pretty well ,  he said. People on softer soils might also feel stronger shaking. Among those creatures startled by the quake were the feathered inhabitants of a bald eagle  s nest high above Santa Cruz Island. A National Park Service live web camera trained on the nest shows a parent eagle and three chicks as their tree begins shaking. The parent flies off as the chicks look around bewildered. The parent eagle returns moments later , after the shaking. WATCH : Eagle and chicks on Santa Cruz Island react to 5.3 Channel Islands earthquake https://t.co/Tm7D67mSgP pic.twitter.com/AwvVf6823b  CBS Los Angeles ( @CBSLA ) April 5 , 2018 One of the last quakes to be felt this widely in the L.A. area was a magnitude 4.4 in Encino in 2014. That quake also shook a wide area and was the largest in the Los Angeles area in four years. It was noted by seismologists as the strongest to hit directly under the Santa Monica Mountains in 80 years. Another widely felt earthquake came later that same month , a magnitude 5.1 centered in La Habra. Residents close to the epicenter reported toppled furniture , broken glass and fallen pictures ; several water mains broke , a rock slide caused a car to overturn , and more than a dozen homes and apartments were declared uninhabitable because of possible structural damage. The last time an area earthquake produced more energy than Thursday  s temblor was in 2012 , when a magnitude 5.4 earthquake struck the border town of Brawley in Imperial County. Local officials reported 20 mobile homes shifted from their foundations and cosmetic damage to downtown buildings. The epicenter of Thursday  s quake was south of the Channel Islands. A magnitude 4.8 quake in the same area rattled the region in 2013 , but that epicenter was much closer to the coast , three miles away from Isla Vista , and produced moderate shaking enough to knock down a few photo frames. A park service spokeswoman told KEYT that Thursday  s quake sent some bricks toppling off a chimney from a historic ranch property built in the 1860s on one of the islands. The Santa Barbara area is home to a number of earthquake faults , the largest of which is the Santa Ynez fault , which is 80 miles long and runs just north of the city. That fault is believed to be capable of triggering an earthquake as powerful as magnitude 7.5. Get ready for a major quake. What to do before  and during  a big one  The great Santa Barbara quake of 1925 , recorded at a magnitude 6.8 , destroyed much of the city  s downtown on State Street , damaged rail lines , caused extensive landslides and was felt as far away as Orange County. It killed 13 people. Since the magnitude 7.2 Easter Sunday earthquake of 2010 that hit along the California-Mexico border , there have been 14 earthquakes of magnitude 5 or greater in Southern California. Hauksson estimated that perhaps about half of them were felt in Los Angeles. Seismologist Lucy Jones said she received a complaint Thursday about her calling earthquake activity like this normal. Some people on Twitter asked her what the larger meaning was behind the earthquake. But there isn  t any larger meaning nor a clue of when the next big earthquake will come or where it will hit , she said. There  s a human need for creating patterns ,  Jones said. It doesn  t make us safer or less safe. It  s a reminder of our reality.  Earthquake activity in the Channel Islands shouldn  t be all that surprising. After all , earthquakes created the Channel Islands. In fact , mountains throughout California are generally creations of earthquakes , Jones said. Earthquakes pushed up the Santa Ynez Mountains in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The Santa Monica and Hollywood faults were responsible for creating the Santa Monica Mountains. The Sierra Madre fault is pushing up the San Gabriels. The Chino Hills were thrust upward by the Chino Hills fault. If you see mountains in California , that means something is moving up those mountains faster than erosion is wearing them down ,  Jones said in an interview. Basically , when you see mountains , think earthquakes in California.

138,"Eric Clapton has said he will not perform at any venues that require attendees to show proof of vaccination. In response to the government announcement that vaccination passports will be required to access nightclubs and venues by the end of September , the musician has issued a statement saying he would not play any stage where there is a discriminated audience present. Unless there is provision made for all people to attend , I reserve the right to cancel the show.  Clapton shared the statement via the Telegram account of Italian architect and lockdown sceptic Robin Monotti. It was accompanied by a link to Clapton  s anti-lockdown collaboration with Van Morrison , Stand and Deliver , in which they sing : Do you wanna be a free man / Or do you wanna be a slave ?  In May , Clapton shared his negative experiences of receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine through Monotti  s Telegram account , claiming to have experienced severe  reactions that left him questioning whether he would be able to play the guitar again. Most people who are reluctant to be vaccinated against Covid are worried about side-effects and whether the vaccines have been adequately tested , a survey of 68,000 people in 15 countries has shown. Running since last year , it found that until March 2021 , the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was the most trusted in the UK among the under-65s , but that confidence in it had declined in all age groups with the publicity over side-effects. Since May , people under 40 have been offered an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab in the UK. In May , the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said : Our advice remains that the benefits of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca outweigh the risks in the majority of people. It is still vitally important that people come forward for their vaccination when invited to do so.  In the same month , Clapton said he had found common ground with Morrison , whose lyrics echoed in my heart  . After releasing Stand and Deliver , Clapton said he was immediately regaled with contempt and scorn  . Clapton  s next scheduled UK performances are at the Royal Albert Hall in May 2022. The venue will host the Proms from 30 July to 11 September without social distancing. Attendees will be required to provide status of their vaccination or immunity status .|||||Vaccine passports will be compulsory to enter packed venues such as nightclubs in an extraordinary U-turn announced by Boris Johnson hours after clubs were allowed to open for the first time in 16 months. In a move that provoked an immediate backlash from Conservative backbenchers and the entertainment sector , the prime minister said that from late September , once all adults have had the chance to receive two jabs , Covid vaccine certificates would be made mandatory in England. I should serve notice now that by the end of September , when all over-18s will have had their chance to be double-jabbed , we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather ,  he said. Unlike at pilot events , where customers have been allowed to show evidence of a negative test , they will have to prove they have been double-jabbed amid concerns in government about vaccine uptake among young people. Approximately 35 % of 18- to 30-year-olds are unvaccinated , he said. Addressing younger people directly , Johnson said : Some of life  s most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination.  Less than 18 hours after almost all Covid restrictions were formally scrapped , allowing clubs to open and putting an end to mandatory masks and social distancing , the prime minister expressed concern about what he called the continuing risk posed by nightclubs  . From just after midnight on Sunday , thousands of revellers were pictured dancing at clubs across the country as they celebrated freedom day  . Johnson was delivering a press conference from Chequers , where he is self-isolating after contact with the health secretary , Sajid Javid , who has tested positive for Covid. The prime minister spoke alongside England  s deputy chief medical officer , Prof Jonathan Van-Tam , and the chief scientific adviser , Sir Patrick Vallance , both of whom struck a sombre tone about the challenges ahead. Vallance said hospitalisations could rise quite a lot higher  than 1,000 a day as the lifting of restrictions allows more socialising , while Van-Tam repeatedly underlined the risks of unvaccinated people gathering in crowded indoor venues. Asked what would happen if the NHS struggles to cope over the summer , Van-Tam said the Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies ( Sage ) would have to make recommendations , which could focus on close contact indoors  . As ministers scramble to manage the fallout from surging Covid cases , Johnson also announced that a very small number of named , fully vaccinated , critical workers  would be allowed to return to work after being ordered to self-isolate. These workers , in sectors such as the police , energy supply , food production and transport , will be allowed to leave quarantine , solely to work , if they take a negative PCR test and continue to have daily rapid tests. Their employer will have to consult with the relevant government department before allowing them to return. Conservative backbenchers were quick to criticise the new plans to make vaccine certificates compulsory for some venues. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said : Vaccination is sensible. But it is entirely wrong to try to coerce people into having them.  Mark Harper , a Tory MP and former chief whip who leads the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group , suggested the government could struggle to win support for the measures among other Conservatives in parliament. He said : I have to say I don  t welcome the minister  s statement , particularly vaccine passports for crowded venues , which is effectively moving to compulsory vaccination. I do however look forward to the debate and the vote in parliament when he will bring forward the evidence because I don  t think that is supported by the pilots that have taken place.  Ministers had previously backed away from the compulsory use of coronavirus certificates  which involve customers using the NHS app to show their vaccination status  in part because of backbench Tory hostility. In a recent vote on compulsory vaccinations for care workers 31 Conservatives rebelled. Labour and the Liberal Democrats oppose the plans , raising the possibility that Conservative rebels could defeat them when they come to parliament in the autumn. Justin Madders , shadow health minister , said : This make-it-up-as-you-go-along government is causing more chaos when what people and businesses need is certainty. How can it be safe to go to nightclubs now , with no protective measures , if in September it will require double jab status ? It makes no sense.  The Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said : Vaccine passports are Covid ID cards : unworkable , expensive and divisive.  Businesses reacted with fury. Michael Kill , chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association , said : What an absolute shambles  The government  s own report into vaccine passports found they were more trouble than they  re worth  so what could possibly explain the about-turn , just as millions across the UK experience their first taste of a night out in a year and a half ?  The latest survey from the Office for National Statistics , carried out in the month to 20 June , found that about 10 % of all people aged 16-29 reported being hesitant to get the Covid vaccine , dropping to 5 % for those aged 30-49 and 1 % for over-50s .|||||Eric Clapton says the side effects from the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine left him thinking he may never play guitar again , the Los Angeles Times reports. In a letter to Italian architect Robin Monotti Graziadei , which Graziadei shared on the Telegram app , per the Hill , the 76-year-old rocker says that while "" the propaganda said the vaccine was safe for everyone , "" his experience was "" disastrous.

139,"' Megadrought ' emerging in the western US might be worse than any in 1,200 years Show Caption Hide Caption Will temperatures continue to rise in the U.S. ? If you think it ' s hot now , just wait. Heat waves are becoming more frequent globally. But how do we measure heat waves ? We explain. Just the FAQs , USA TODAY Scientists say that about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming. The study covers an area stretching across nine U.S. states from Oregon down to New Mexico. Naturally-occurring western megadroughts have occurred many times before. Fueled in part by human-caused climate change , a megadrought  appears to be emerging in the western U.S. , a study published Thursday suggests. In fact , the nearly-20-year drought is almost as bad or worse than any in the past 1,200 years , scientists say. Megadroughts  defined as intense droughts that last for decades or longer  once plagued the Desert Southwest. Thanks to global warming , an especially fierce one appears to be coming back : "" We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we ' re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts , "" said study lead author A. Park Williams , a bioclimatologist at Columbia University , in a statement. This is a drought bigger than what modern society has seen. "" Scientists say that about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming. Some of the impacts today include shrinking reservoirs and worsening wildfire seasons. What do you want to know ? We ' re answering coronavirus questions daily. Ask here. Since temperatures are projected to keep rising , it is likely the drought will continue for the near future  or fade briefly only to return , researchers say. The study covers an area stretching across nine U.S. states from Oregon and Montana down through California , New Mexico and part of northern Mexico. Daniel Swain , a UCLA climate scientist who wasn  t part of the study , called the research important because it provides evidence that human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the megadroughts  of centuries past.  What winter ? : Earth just had its second-warmest December-February on record Williams said that "" because the background is getting warmer , the dice are increasingly loaded toward longer and more severe droughts. We may get lucky , and natural variability will bring more precipitation for a while. "" But going forward , we ' ll need more and more good luck to break out of drought , and less and less bad luck to go back into drought , "" he said. Williams said the region could stay dry for centuries. "" That ' s not my prediction right now , but it ' s possible. "" Naturally occurring western megadroughts have taken place many times before. In fact , most of the USA ' s droughts of the past century , even the 1930s Dust Bowl that forced migrations of Oklahomans and others from the Plains , "" were exceeded in severity and duration multiple times by droughts during the preceding 2,000 years , "" the National Climate Assessment said. Megadroughts : Will plague the Southwest as climate warms , study says The difference now , of course , is the western USA is home to more than 70 million people who weren ' t here for the previous medieval megadroughts. The implications are far more daunting. University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck , who studies southwestern climate and was not part of the study , calls this drought the first observed multidecadal megadrought in recorded U.S. history.  Global warming : 2020 expected to be Earth ' s warmest year on record , scientists say To identify past droughts , scientists studied thousands of tree rings to find out how much  or little  rain fell hundreds of years ago. Scientists used historical data in combination with several computer model simulations to reach their conclusions. One additional worrisome fact from the study was that the 20th century was the wettest century in the entire 1,200-year record. It was during that time that the population boomed in the western U.S. , and that has continued. "" The 20th century gave us an overly optimistic view of how much water is potentially available , "" said study co-author Benjamin Cook , a NASA climate scientist , in a statement. "" It goes to show that studies like this are not just about ancient history , "" he said. "" They ' re about problems that are already here. "" The study was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Science. Contributing : The Associated Press"
140,"Saturday ' s massive earthquake in Nepal killed nearly than 2,000 people , destroyed historic temples and sent an avalanche racing down Everest in the mountain ' s deadliest day ever. Ang Tshering Sherpa , President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association , told NBC News Sunday that 17 bodies have been recovered at Mount Everest base camp and 61 people were injured in the avalanche. At least one of the dead climbers was identified Saturdayas Google engineer Dan Fredinburg. Previously , the highest number of deaths on a single day on Everest was 16. That day was a year and a week ago , on April 18 , 2014 , when an avalanche just above base camp killed 16 Nepali sherpas who were trying to carve out a route for foreign climbers. Gallery : Hundreds Killed in Nepal Earthquake The avalanche sparked a debate about the high-risk and meager pay that sherpas work for : They make up to $ 5,000 a year in a country where the annual income is just over $ 700 , according to Reuters. While the mountain has taken the lives of many over the years , it ' s rare for so many people to die in one single incident there. Before 2014 , the deadliest day for Everest was a 1996 blizzard that killed eight people. The storm was chronicled in the book "" Into Thin Air , "" by Jon Krakauer. Saturday ' s avalanche buried part of the base camp. Nepal ' s Tourism Ministry could only confirm 10 deaths , but the number was likely to rise. At this time of year , Everest base camp is "" almost a small little city , "" with anywhere from 500 to 800 climbers and support staff there , said Eric Larsen , a polar adventurer and expedition guide who lives in Colorado. April is the start of the climbing season and a popular time to scale the 29,035-foot mountain , when spring still offers sunshine. By the end of May , rain and clouds hover over it , and the summer monsoon season begins. Temperatures this time of year can be a comfortable 60 degrees during the day or as cold as the teens. The avalanche struck between the Khumbu Icefall  a treacherous , icy , snowy area  and base camp , flattening tents of climbers who were preparing to go to Everest ' s summit. "" Generally speaking , Everest base camp is a very safe place to be in the sense that you ' re usually out of trouble from avalanches , "" Larsen told NBC News. "" Camping there , you can hear the rumbling ice below you if you ' re camped on the Khumbu glacier proper , but for the most part , it ' s often quite a relief to be there. "" Limited communication on Everest made it difficult to get information about how many deaths were at base camp and how many were elsewhere on the mountain. Saturday ' s quake , a 7.9-magnitude tremor , was centered 50 miles from the capital of Kathmandu. IN-DEPTH  Elizabeth Chuck|||||Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest ( the author was , of course , part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed ) . His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain ' s peak , but before arriving at that point , he shares a fascinating backstory : That of Himex , a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most "" lucrative commercial guiding operation "" on Everest  one that on May 7 , 2012 , packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home , taking its guides , members ( aka paying climbers , who didn ' t see their $ 60,000 refunded ) , and Sherpas with them. story continues below The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice , who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain ' s Nepal side , an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes , the "" wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion "" that broke free and caused last week ' s avalanche came from "" that same ice bulge "" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face , some standout points : Between 1921 and 1996 , the mountain ' s death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present , the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it ' s gotten safer : Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen , and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet , which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter ( and are , of course , the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain ) . Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas : US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007 , miners , and commercial fishermen.

142,"On April 12 , wildlife authorities and conservationists completed a tall task : ferrying the final two giraffes off of a sinking island in Lake Baringo , Kenya , George Dvorsky reports for Gizmodo. For many years , Rothschild  s giraffes ( Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi ) have lived on a peninsula in the lake. The lake ' s water levels had been slowly rising over time , but in 2020 , torrential rains caused severe flooding , covering a stretch of the giraffes  peninsula and turning the end into a muddy , shrinking island. Nine giraffes became stranded with limited resources available for survival. Planning the complex rescue mission took 15 months to coordinate and implement. Now , the last two individuals  a mother and a calf , named Ngarikoni and Noelle  stuck on a remote part of the land mass have been safely transported to the mainland. When the giraffes reached the shore , they galloped out onto the 4,400-acre Ruko Wildlife Sanctuary , where conservation groups involved in the project hope to support a growing population of the endangered subspecies. And here ' s another clip of the giraffe named Lbarnoti ' s excited gallop once he ' s safely gotten off the ferry. Video Credit : Mike Parkei , Northern Rangelands Trust/Save Giraffes Now pic.twitter.com/AcH7PHkE7M  Aylin Woodward ( @AylinWoodward ) January 31 , 2021 When the giraffes first became stranded on the island , Ruko wildlife rangers began delivering food for them , per Gizmodo. But they soon realized the need for a more sustainable long-term solution. The flood became severe last year , damaging businesses and homes along the shore of the lake , and one giraffe , named Asiwa , became separated from the rest of herd when flooding bisected the island once again. Convincing a 14-foot-tall animal to get on a boat is no small feat , however. First , the team needed to develop a vessel fit for the task. The result , a barge that is kept afloat by 60 empty drums , decked-out with reinforced walls and pulled by a motorboat , was named the GiRaft.  To guide the animals to the raft , the team first had to sedate them , and then quickly apply a reversal drug. ( When a giraffe is tranquilized and falls to the ground , it is in danger of choking on its own saliva , or being harmed by a change of blood pressure to its brain. ) During the brief period when a giraffe is sedated , the team covers its face with a blindfold and sets up guide ropes around its shoulders. Then when the giraffe is able to walk , the team guides it to the raft. When the rescue brought Asiwa to the raft , she was incredible ,  said O  Connor to CNN  s Ami Vitale in December. She ' s a very , very tough girl.  Once we got her onto a more open space where there was an established track , she just walked straight onto the barge. Sometimes it looked like someone was walking a puppy on a Sunday afternoon. It was amazing.  Rescue workers accompanied the GiRaft on its one-mile journey to shore by standing on the steel beams or boating alongside in kayaks and canoes. As Mindy Weisberger reports for Live Science , the Rothschild  s giraffe has lost about 80 percent of its population in the last 30 years , making it one of the most imperiled giraffe subspecies. Out of a population of less than 3,000 animals , 800 live in Kenya. Now that the once-stranded giraffes are on the mainland , the conservation groups hope to relocate other giraffes of the same subspecies to the wildlife sanctuary to support a healthy , genetically diverse population .|||||Since December 2020 , nine giraffes have been carried by barge across the waters of Lake Baringo. How do you save a herd of giraffes that are trapped on a rapidly sinking island ? Float them to the mainland on a custom-built barge  a "" GiRaft. "" That ' s how a months-long giraffe rescue operation in Kenya recently concluded on April 12 , delivering the last of nine stranded giraffes to safety , according to a statement by Save Giraffes Now ( SGN ) , an American nonprofit organization that partnered with conservationists in Kenya to relocate the giraffes. The threatened giraffes , a highly endangered subspecies called Rothschild ' s giraffes ( Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi ) , had been living on Longicharo Island in Kenya ' s Lake Baringo since 2011. But rising waters repeatedly flooded their habitat , and conservationists , concerned that the giraffes could no longer find enough food on the island , decided to evacuate the animals. Related : Rare white giraffe photographed "" Water levels in Lake Baringo have been rising for some time , but in 2020 the rate of rise increased , "" flooding coastal homes and businesses and threatening the survival of the giraffes , representatives of Kenya ' s Northern Rangelands Trust ( NRT ) posted on Facebook on Dec. 2 , 2020 , when the giraffe evacuation began. To carry the gangly giraffes from their disappearing home to a new sanctuary on the mainland , SGN worked with NRT and other local conservation agencies : Ruko Community Conservancy and Kenya Wildlife Service. People from the Njemps and Pokot communities designed and built a giraffe-toting barge with tall , reinforced sides , buoyed by 60 empty drums and towed by boats. Tall sides on the GiRaft kept the animals safe during the 1-mile ( 1.6 kilometer ) journey. ( Image credit : Northern Rangeland Trust ) Rangers helped the giraffes get used to the GiRaft over time by parking it on land and encouraging the animals to investigate it by loading the barge with delicious treats , such as mangos , seed pods , food pellets and acacia leaves , according to the SGN. Once the giraffes were familiar with the GiRaft , rescuers transported them one at a time to higher ground in an enclosed sanctuary at the 44,000-acre ( 178square-kilometer ) Ruko Conservancy , located about 1 mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) across the lake from the island. The first passenger to board the GiRaft was a female giraffe named Asiwa , as rising waters had already separated her from the rest of the herd , NRT representatives wrote on Facebook. Over the following months , more giraffes were taken across the lake , and on April 12 , the last remaining giraffes  a female named Ngarikoni and her baby Noelle , born at the end of December  completed the journey , according to the statement. A young giraffe named "" Susan "" bounds off the barge after her trip to the mainland. ( Image credit : Northern Rangeland Trust ) Giraffe populations in general have declined by about 40 % over the past three decades , but Rothschild ' s giraffe numbers have dwindled by approximately 80 % , making it "" arguably one of the most imperiled giraffe subspecies , "" according to a study published in 2019 in the African Journal of Ecology . Rothschild ' s giraffes were once widespread across Kenya , Uganda and southern Sudan. Now only around 3,000 remain in isolated populations in Uganda and Kenya , lending a greater urgency to the GiRaft rescue mission , SGN president David O ' Connor said in the statement. "" With giraffes undergoing a silent extinction , every one we can protect matters , making this rescue an important step in supporting the survival of this species , "" O ' Connor said. The happy ending to the island giraffes ' story also reflects a landmark collaboration between the Njemps and Pokot communities , which have united in conservation efforts after years of conflict.

143,"HOLLYWOOD producers have arrived in Thailand and are already plotting a movie about the young boys and their soccer coach trapped in a cave  before they  re all out. THIS will make a great movie some day.  It  s a sentiment that  s echoed around the globe as millions of people watch on and champion the ongoing rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach stuck in a Thailand cave , in the country  s north. But for some Hollywood producers , there  s no time to waste , and some day  may as well be now. A US film crew has already arrived at the foothills of the Tham Luang mountain cave system in Chiang Rai province as one of the world  s most daring rescue operations enters its third day. Divers are expected to today attempt to bring 25-year-old coach Ekkapol Aek  Chantawong and the remaining four boys  aged 11 to 16  to safety in a dangerous and highly complex operation. One Navy SEAL has already died trying to save the team which became trapped in a dark , flooded chamber on June 23 and has been imprisoned for more than two weeks. Eight of the boys have been rescued over the past two days and are recovering in a nearby hospital. Meanwhile , two American producers are already plotting a movie project about the Wild Boars youth soccer team and their coach in anticipation of global box office success. Pure Flix films managing partner Michael Scott told AAP in Chiang Rai , I see this as a major Hollywood film with A-list stars  . Mr Scott and co-producer Adam Smith have been conducting preliminary interviews around the Tham Luang cave site , where a final push is now underway to complete the rescue of the group of 13 who became trapped in the caves by rising flood waters more than two weeks ago. Mr Scott and Mr Smith also plan to bring in a screenwriter and interview key players from the team of foreign rescuers and Thai Navy SEALS , the victims and their families and seek exclusive rights to their stories. Asked if their actions might be seen as insensitive at such a delicate time , Mr Smith said : There  s going to be other production companies coming in so we have to act pretty quickly.  So far , eight of the boys , aged 11 to 16 years , have successfully been brought to the surface by a daisy chain of divers who guided them through 4km of narrow , murky water-filled passages.

The journey takes the divers about 11 hours to get in and out. Another attempt will be made later on Tuesday to try to get the remaining boys and the coach out. The rescue team being lead by Thai authorities includes a number of foreigners , including Australians and Adelaide anaesthetist Dr Richard Harris , a seasoned rescue diver. Mr Scott , who  s married to a Thai woman and spends three months a year in Thailand , said they are not pressing people over the interviews. I  ve told them once this has died down let  s really sit down and have a more in-depth interview on what  s really happening ,  he said. Pure Flix is based in Scottsdale , Arizona and Los Angeles and describes itself as a faith and family production and distribution film company. Its biggest film so far is God  s not Dead ( 2014 ) , which made close to $ US70 million worldwide produced on a budget of $ US2 million.

This just kind of fits our DNA in terms of a really inspirational story ,  he said during an interview conducted late Monday. It  s got incredible heart , incredible acts of heroism and bravery. It  s just an incredible thing and we think it will inspire millions around the world.  Mr Smith , who also runs KAOS Entertainment in Bangkok , said it  s apolitical , it has no agenda. Everyone is on the same page and everyone is rooting for them  . Mr Scott said once a name  screenwriter was on board , production was expected to start production in late 2019. News.com.au has contacted the film crew for further comment. National Cave Rescue Mission co-ordinator Anmar Mirza yesterday told CBS News it would be difficult to recreate the story as a movie.

144,"The Old West was an infamously dusty place , the grime a symbol of the gritty frontier. But the West may be even dustier today than it was in the past , thanks to a combination of factors that include droughts , land-use changes and more frequent windstorms , a new study suggests. All that dust blowing around has implications both for the places that the dust comes from and the places that it lands , because "" dust storms cause a large-scale reorganization of nutrients on the surface of the Earth , "" said study leader Janice Brahney , a doctoral student at the University of Colorado at Boulder when the research was done. While reports of dust storms from Western residents , along with observations of dust on mountain snowpacks , pointed to a rise in the amount of dust blowing around , "" we don ' t routinely monitor dust in most places , which means we don ' t have a good handle on how the material is moving , when it ' s moving and where it ' s going , "" Brahney said in a university release on the research. Counting calcium To get a better , more quantitative look at just how much dust was blowing around the West , and to see whether that amount might be rising , Brahney and her adviser Jason Neff looked at the amount of calcium deposited by precipitation. Calcium can be whipped up into the atmosphere through power plant emissions , ocean spray and , key to this study , the erosion of soils. It is then washed back down the planet ' s surface by falling precipitation. Brahney and the study team looked at calcium deposition data from 175 sites across the country collected by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program between 1994 and 2010. They found that calcium deposition had increased at 116 sites , with the biggest rises found in the Northwest , Midwest and Intermountain West. In particular , Colorado , Wyoming and Utah saw big increases. The team cross-checked those increases against the potential sources , and found no increases in industrial emissions , ocean spray or forest fires , suggesting that windblown dust was the culprit and was indeed on the rise. The calcium measurements are likely an underestimate of the dust being blown around too , Brahney said , because some dust is simply blown around by the wind ; not all of it collides with water in the atmosphere. And not all dust contains the same amounts of calcium. Dust impacts All this dust wafting through Western air has several potential impacts : It can cause declines in air quality ; the impoverishment of the soils from which the dust is blown , because the wind picks up the smallest particles , which are the ones that contain the most nutrients ; and faster snowpack melt , because dust landing on snow darkens it and causes it to absorb sunlight more quickly. Neff ' s lab hopes to get a better picture of dust being blow around by measuring it directly , using specific dust-measuring instruments installed at sites throughout the region , the release noted. The study , funded by the National Science Foundation , was recently detailed online in the journal Aeolian Research. Follow Andrea Thompson @AndreaTOAP , Pinterest and Google+.

USA TODAY WASHINGTON  A vaccine expert who said he was ousted after raising concerns about a drug President Donald Trump touted as a potential treatment for coronavirus filed a whistleblower complaint Tuesday alleging longstanding political influence at the Department of Health and Human Services. Rick Bright , who until recently served as director of the HHS Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , also said he raised alarms about the coronavirus  and the need to ramp up production of face masks and other personal protective equipment  with White House officials as far back as January. Bright says in the report that he resisted widespread use of hydroxychloroquine , which Trump had repeatedly touted , because the claims of its benefit lacked scientific merit.

146,"Aug. 23 , 2012 -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott today sought to calm fears about a possible hurricane threatening to close down the Republican National Convention next week in Tampa , Fla. , telling reporters this afternoon , "" Right now , there is not any anticipation there will be a cancellation. "" Scott , a Republican , said it is "" still too early "" to know exactly where Tropical Storm Isaac , which is expected to intensify into a hurricane on Friday , will hit Florida and , thus , too early to make evacuation plans , or postpone or call off the convention. "" If you look at the projected path , it looks like we ' ll have some wind and some rain , "" Scott said. "" But we are going to have a great convention. We look forward to the delegates coming and we ' re going to keep them safe. "" Scott said he personally spoke with likely GOP nominee Mitt Romney about Florida ' s storm preparations. "" I gave him assurance that this is a state that has dealt with hurricanes in the past and we are ready if that happens ; but again , hopefully that doesn ' t happen , "" Scott said. "" The nice thing would be is if it turns into a nice little rainstorm. That would be nice. "" By most predictions , bad weather looms next week for Tampa. Heavy rains and strong winds are likely to pound the city early Tuesday morning , less than 24 hours after the start of the Republican National Convention , where GOP delegates will nominate Romney and his running mate , Paul Ryan , to take on President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in November. Tropical Storm Isaac is heading along a western track , dumping rain on Puerto Rico this morning and swirling about 1,000 miles off the Florida coast as of 5 p.m. , according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm has shifted father west throughout Thursday and is now predicted to hit about 150 miles west of Tampa. "" The hope is this is going to go away , but if it doesn ' t , the convention is ready , the state is ready and the local communities are ready , "" Scott said. Republican National Convention CEO William Harris said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the RNC is tracking the storm , but that they "" continue to move forward "" with the convention plans. "" Gov. Scott and local emergency officials have assured us that they have the resources in place to respond to this storm should it make landfall , as our primary concern is with those in the potential path of the storm , "" Harris said in the statement. "" We continue to move forward with our planning and look forward to a successful convention. "" But while Scott and GOP convention planners are hoping for the best , "" nothing indicates this thing is going to go away , "" said Dennis Feltgen , spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami. "" Unfortunately , we can ' t wish this one away , "" he said. "" The best-case scenario for the state of Florida is that it ' s far enough west that it will have minimal impact. "" At the Sirata Beach Resort in St. Petersburg , about 30 miles from the Tampa Convention Center , where the New Jersey and Minnesota delegations are staying , there is little concern about the impending tropical storm. Rather than canceling reservations , delegates are trying to come in early , moving their reservations to Saturday or Sunday instead of Monday. They have had 100 additional reservations for Saturday and Sunday in the past few days. "" It ' s rain , it ' s really just rain , "" said Cricket Wagner , the director of sales at Sirata Beach Resort. "" Hotels ... don ' t have the cheap aluminum roof on them. They ' re not going to blow over. "" Wagner said because of their convention prep , they are more prepared for a hurricane than usual. They have extra generators , which they plan to use for a convention beach party Monday night but can use to power the ballrooms during a hurricane. And they have a refrigerated semi-truck full of extra food in the parking lot that they plan to use for the party , but can divert to hurricane back-up food if need be. While prediction models are notoriously inaccurate this far in advance , Isaac is projected to slam into Haiti Saturday morning and hit Florida about 150 miles west of Tampa in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The city , which by then will be buzzing with about 50,000 Republican delegates , journalists and protesters , could see 70 mph winds , coastal flooding and heavy rains. "" It will be a dangerous situation , "" ABC meteorologist Max Golembo said. "" It ' s somewhere between the galoshes and Noah ' s Ark. "" Golembo gave the storm a 50 percent chance of hitting Tampa. After the storm passes over the high mountains of Haiti and the Dominican Republic , where it is expected to dump 20 inches of rain and cause mudslides and flooding , and through Cuba Sunday morning , prediction models will have a clearer picture of how damaging the storm could be for the Tampa Bay area. While Isaac looks to be heading farther west of Tampa that originally projected , it will likely deliver hurricane-force winds of 75 mph or greater , strong enough to break windows , down trees and damage roofs , Golembo said. If winds exceed 45 mph , some of the bridges connecting downtown Tampa , where the bulk of the GOP convention action will be , with the hotels where some delegates are staying , will have to be closed , said Bryan Koon , director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. "" There is a lot of low-lying areas in the Tampa Bay area that could be flooded as a result of this , and some of those may be locations where the delegates are housed , "" Koon said. "" Beautiful location , wonderful hotels , but they ' re oceanfront , so they may be impacted by some storm surge issues. "" Both the Tampa Bay Times Forum and the Tampa Convention Center , where the majority of the Republican National Convention ' s events will take place , overlook the bay and are in evacuation zones. "" If you get a large enough storm in there , there is the potential that the storm surge could drive water up towards them and cause some flooding issues , "" Koon added. Republican National Committee spokesman James Davis told ABC News Tuesday that he was "" confident we will be able to get the business done of our convention , which is to nominate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. "" "" We are monitoring the storm and we will have more information if it comes closer , "" Davis said. "" Right now , we are looking forward to having a great convention. "" Presumptive vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan said Tuesday night that he did not know what the Republican National Committee ' s plans were for dealing with any bad weather , only that the committee has a plan. "" Your guess is as good as mine , "" Ryan said on the Mark Levin radio show. "" I don ' t know exactly what the plans are , but they tell me that we ' re in pretty good shape and they ' ve got a plan in place . ""|||||Tropical Storm Isaac still has the potential to foul up Republicans ' convention plans in Florida , but relief agencies are more worried about Haiti at the moment. Isaac is expected to be at hurricane strength when it rolls in tomorrow night  the first major storm to hit since the 2010 earthquake , reports CNN. Especially vulnerable are the more than 400,000 people still living in refugee camps around Port-au-Prince. story continues below The storm should hit Tampa on Monday , though the Tampa Bay Times reports that the latest computer models show it tracking further west of Florida , which would lessen the impact. Forecasters will know more as they watch Isaac ' s path and strength over the next few days.

The people of the city of New Orleans , through their elected government , had made the decision to take down four Confederate monuments  statues of Robert E Lee , Jefferson Davis and Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard , and a monument honoring the White League , a Reconstruction era organization of racial militants  and it wasn  t sitting well with some of the powerful business interests in the state. When I put out a bid for contractors to take the statues down , a few responded. But they were immediately attacked on social media , got threatening calls at work and at home , and were , in general , harassed. Afraid , most naturally backed away. One contractor stayed with us  but then his car was firebombed. From that moment on , I couldn  t find anyone willing to take the statues down. I tried aggressive , personal appeals. I did whatever I could. I personally drove around the city and took pictures of the countless cranes and crane companies working on dozens of active construction projects across New Orleans. My staff called every construction company and every project foreman. We were blacklisted. Opponents sent a strong message that any company that dared step forward to help the city would pay a price economically and even personally. Can you imagine ? In the second decade of the 21st century , tactics as old as burning crosses or social exclusion , just dressed up a little bit , were being used to stop what was now an official act authorized by the government in the legislative , judicial and executive branches. This is the very definition of institutionalized racism. You may have the law on your side , but if someone else controls the money , the machines or the hardware you need to make your new law work , you are screwed. This is the difference between de jure and de facto discrimination in today  s world. You can finally win legally , but still be completely unable to get the job done. Protesters of the monuments look on as the statue of the Confederate president , Jefferson Davis , is removed on 11 May 2017. Photograph : Dinah Rogers/EPA As I continued to look for someone who would tear down those monuments , I learned more and more that this is exactly what has happened to African Americans over the last three centuries. The picture painted by African Americans of institutional racism is real  and it was acting itself out on the streets of New Orleans during this process in real time. Learning the story of these structures , why they were built and by whom , made clear to me , probably for the first time in my life , the lens through which many , though certainly not all , Southerners have seen our regional identity since the civil war. The statues were not honoring history , or heroes. They were created as political weapons , part of an effort to hide the truth , which is that the Confederacy was on the wrong side of not just of history , but of humanity. The Confederacy was on the wrong side of not just of history , but of humanity The monuments helped distort history , putting forth a myth of Southern chivalry , the gallant Lost Cause  , to distract from the terror tactics that deprived African Americans of fundamental rights from the Reconstruction years through Jim Crow until the civil rights movement and the federal court decisions of the 1960s. Institutional inequities in the economic , education , criminal justice and housing systems exist to this very day. The misuse of history is inflamed by the anger burning through demonstrations today , anger fueled by white supremacists and neo-Nazis who have stolen the meaning of Southern heritage from many whites who abhor their ideology but still hold hard to a rose-colored nostalgia for the past. I am well aware of the emotional investment of many Southerners whose ancestors fought in the civil war , of the popular interest in historical events , of how families lost loved ones , came through , and coped. I do not mean dishonor to these people. My concern is with the political meaning of the monuments in New Orleans , who put them there , and why : the perversion of history. Once I learned the real history of these statues , I knew there was only one path forward , and that meant making straight what was crooked , making right what was wrong. It starts with telling the truth about the past. These last eight years have given me the wonderful privilege of serving as mayor of the city where I was born and raised. New Orleans is a town with a song in its heart and a swing in its step. We also have a history of racial injustice that we must never stop confronting in order to build a stronger and more equitable city for all who call it home. In the end , we got a crane. But even then , opponents at one point found their way to one of our machines and poured sand in the gas tank. Other protesters flew drones at the contractors to thwart their work. But we kept plodding through. We were successful , but only because we took extraordinary security measures to safeguard equipment and workers , and we agreed to conceal their identities. Everyone alive today has inherited this country  s difficult history. The big message we should hear from the streets of Baltimore and Ferguson and Charlottesville and New Orleans is that we are not done  we have more work to do.

148,"A new discovery has been made at Armant Temple , 25 kilometres south of Luxor. A mission from the French Institute for Oriental Studies ( IFAO ) unearthed a limestone head of the 18th dynasty king Amenhotep III , grandfather of king Tutankhamen. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh El-Damaty told Ahram Online that the head was accidentally found during restoration and consolidation works carried out at the temple ' s foundations. Aly El-Asfar , head of the Central Administration of Upper Egypt , told Ahram Online that the head is carved in sandstone and in very bad condition. The face is totally damaged but a part of the crown still exists. The head is now under restoration at the gallery of the IFAO in Luxor. He continued that last year the mission unearthed five heads of royal priests within the temple. The heads are carved in limestone and each one has the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt on top. Each head is 50 centimetres high and could date back to the Middle Kingdom. Armant temple was dedicated to worshipping the falcon-headed god of war Montu. It was originally built during the Old Kingdom but it was reused during the Ptolemaic period , although decorations and additions continued to be added centuries later by the Romans. Because of Montu ' s strong association with raging bulls , the temple was a major centre for the worship for bulls , containing many statues and reliefs of the animal. Most of these statues are now located in museums around the world. Search Keywords : Short link :|||||At some point about 4,000 years ago , a female aristocrat in her 30s died in southern Egypt.

The statue was re-erected at the northern gate of the king  s funerary temple on the west bank of the Nile. The temple is already famous for its 3,400-year-old Memnon colossi  twin statues of Amenhotep III , whose reign archaeologists say marked the political and cultural zenith of ancient Egyptian civilisation. The 12.9-metre ( 43ft ) statue unveiled on Sunday stands west of another effigy of the king , also depicting him walking , which was unveiled in March. These are up to now the highest standing effigies of an Egyptian king in striding attitude ,  said German-Armenian archaeologist Hourig Sourouzian , who heads the project to conserve the temple. The twin Memnon colossi are 21 metres tall but show the pharaoh seated. The restored statue now stands again for the first time since its collapse 3,200 years ago , Sourouzian said. Consisting of 89 large pieces and numerous small fragments and reassembled since November , the monolith weighs 110 tonnes. It had lain broken in pieces after an earthquake in 1200BC , Sourouzian said. The statue shows the king wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt , and each hand holding a papyrus roll inscribed with his name. His belt , holding a dagger with a falcon-head handle , is fastened with a rectangular clasp bearing the names of the king. Pharaoh Amenhotep III inherited an empire that stretched from the Euphrates to Sudan , archaeologists say. The 18th dynasty ruler became king aged around 12 , with his mother as regent. Amenhotep III died in around 1354BC and was succeeded by his son Amenhotep IV , widely known as Akhenaten ."
149,"San Francisco -- A fast-moving fire that consumed a large apartment building under construction in San Francisco ' s Mission Bay neighborhood burned into the night Tuesday , but firefighters were able to keep the blaze from spreading to nearby structures. The five-alarm fire engulfed the building on Fourth Street near China Basin Street just before 5 p.m. , sending black smoke thousands of feet into the sky. Scaffolding melted as chunks of the six-story , 80-foot-tall building fell away. Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White called it the city ' s largest blaze in several years. Fire officials said the structure was likely to collapse. "" The open construction of the building allowed for rapid fire spread , "" said fire Capt. Matthew McNaughton , adding that investigators have not determined what started the blaze. Nearby buildings were evacuated as more than 150 firefighters battled the flames , using about 90 fire trucks and other apparatuses. The roof of UCSF ' s Mission Bay research building , a block away , briefly caught fire , but it was quickly put out , McNaughton said. One firefighter suffered minor burns , he said , but there were no other injuries. The smoke "" was like a huge mushroom cloud. It was as high as a plane , "" said Gary "" Slim "" Forte , 38 , who was among a large crowd of locals watching the fire. "" It looked like somebody blew a nuclear weapon. "" Several dozen residents were evacuated from the Strata apartment building across Fourth Street from the construction site , and about 25 were gathered late Tuesday at an American Red Cross evacuation center at Pier 54. Firefighters still had not contained the blaze by 10 : 15 p.m. McNaughton said he expected crews to remain on scene until the morning. "" We have a center core that looks like a volcano , "" he said. Construction began last year on the building , part of a 360-unit apartment complex being developed by BRE Properties on the west side of Fourth Street. It was set to be completed late this year. BRE Properties officials issued a statement late Tuesday saying they believe the company ' s insurance should cover the cost of damages. The project stands in the midst of at least four other residential construction projects on or near Fourth Street south of Mission Creek. Together , they contain nearly 900 units. Time to smolder Hayes-White said most of the construction workers ended their day at the building around 4 p.m. , but McNaughton said a few were still on the site when firefighters arrived. Fire investigators believe that whatever sparked the blaze had as long as an hour to smolder. The building ' s sprinkler system had not yet been installed , Hayes-White said , and , as a result , the fire "" really took off. It went up really quickly. "" As sections of the building collapsed , firefighters aimed water cannons at adjacent buildings to keep the blaze from spreading to the rest of the neighborhood. "" This is a great save right here , "" Hayes-White said , pointing to a building across the street. "" We were able to put up a water curtain. To be able to save this is huge. "" Residents and workers in the area described the fire as a quick-moving , monstrous blaze. Carlos Tovar of Manteca was operating a crane 228 feet in the air on another construction project as the apartment building burst into flames. "" I thought it was just a ladder on fire at first , but then as it really got involved , the heat climbed so quickly I could feel it on my cab , "" Tovar said. "" It moved fast , real fast. "" Watching fire spread Tovar shot video with his smartphone as the flames built from just a flicker in the southeast corner of the structure , climbed to the roof and spread west. He said it soon began gobbling up the top part of the building. As night fell , the smoke became white and the flames lessened , but Hayes-White said the structure was probably a total loss. The building is "" likely to come down , "" Hayes-White said. "" It will collapse. The more it burns , the more water we put on it , the more likely it is to fail. "" Local residents said the heat blew out windows and radiant heat burned the front of the Strata building. Residents were evacuated from the 192-unit building. Fire Battalion Chief Richard McGee said evacuated Strata residents weren ' t allowed to return home Tuesday night because the heat from the fire set off Strata ' s sprinkler system. The system would have to be restored in order to be reactivated , he said. Scott McGrath , 35 , rushed back in a taxi from his job in the Financial District to the Strata. He said he was there to save his dog , but firefighters had already cleared the building of pets and people. "" I ' m very appreciative , "" McGrath said. "" They were going around and trying to get as many dogs as they could. "" All around the building where the fire crews attacked , there were rivers of water strewn with debris and broken glass. Some shards were 20 feet from the building. Crews manning three hoses kept up a stream of water on the southeast corner and the south face of the building even as the top floors collapsed. One firefighter manning the crank on his hose wiped his forehead and said , "" This is big , all right. Real big. Lots of water. That ' s what does the trick. "" Clogged streets Davi Lang , 27 , lives in a houseboat a block away and saw the flames as they began their first leap into the air. She ran over and watched as the building was consumed. "" It was huge , "" she said. "" I was worried the water they were spraying on it wouldn ' t even work , it was that huge. The scaffolding was melting , right as I watched. All of a sudden , the top floors just came crumbling down. "" Lang said the fire engines that rushed to the area first couldn ' t get through the construction site because the sites are so tightly packed. "" And a lot of the streets aren ' t even finished yet , "" she said. Hundreds of people lined up along China Basin to watch firefighters battle the flames a few blocks to the south. Along Berry Street on the north edge of the fire zone , onlookers kept trying to sneak through the fencing to get a better look at the fire. Security guards shooed them out. San Francisco Chronicle staff writers Peter Fimrite and John King contributed to this report .|||||SAN FRANCISCO -- One firefighter suffered burns to his face and hands while battling a massive blaze at a nine-story condominium tower still under construction Tuesday , fire officials said late in the evening. San Francisco Fire Department Deputy Chief of Operations Mark Gonzales told local news crews that a firefighter on the first ladder truck that arrived at the 5 p.m. blaze got a little burned up there but didn  t cop to it until four or five hours later.  The firefighter was taken to a hospital and was expected to make a full recovery ,  Gonzales told KCBS radio.

On behalf of the residents of the city and county of San Francisco , I would like to thank Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White and the approximately 150 firefighters from several San Francisco fire stations who responded to what became a five-alarm fire in our Mission Bay neighborhood today ,  Mayor Ed Lee said in a statement issued late Tuesday. Thanks to the leadership and determined action of our Fire Department , the very real potential of severe damage to other homes , businesses and structures in the neighborhood was avoided ,  he said. The fire broke out at the condo construction site on 4th Street between China Basin and Mission Rock -- near AT&T Park -- about 5 p.m. and soon engulfed the structure. The top floors collapsed as crowds gathered at a distance to watch. Sprinklers had not yet been installed in the building , identified in news reports as under development by BRE Properties. Part of the complex survived the blaze , the San Francisco Business Times reported. A cause has not been identified but arson investigators were on the scene and were expected to return Wednesday. We  re told the workers got off around 3 : 30 p.m. so whatever was burning had about an hour and a half to smolder and get going ,  Hayes-White told KTVU-TV Channel 2. The Red Cross was assisting residents from a nearby complex that suffered broken windows from the heat and was evacuated. The sprinklers in that building were triggered and are no longer operational , so residents had to find other accommodations Tuesday night. I saw the smoke starting in the corner and all of a sudden , flames engulfed the whole building ,  Julia Young told KTVU. I knew , time to get out of here.  Hayes-White lauded her crew for saving the second building from destruction. This is a great save right here ,  Hayes-White told reporters. To be able to save this is huge.

In the hills of Montalcino in Tuscany , winemaker Giancarlo Cignozzi has , for more than a decade , been playing Mozart 24 hours a day to a section of Sangiovese grapes growing in his vineyard , reports CBS News. At first , plant scientist Stefano Mancuso thought Cignozzi was just another "" crazy guy , "" but the higher sugar content and robustness of the grapes growing closest to the music intrigued him , and he set about conducting scientific experiments. Bose heard of the studies and in 2008 donated speakers and funding for more research. story continues below Mancuso says that the most "" impressive "" findings are that "" sound is able to reduce dramatically the number of insect attacks , "" possibly because the frequencies confuse bugs enough to prevent breeding. This means the vineyard no longer uses pesticides and even gets away with minimal fertilizer. Another intriguing theory : that because the frequencies are akin to those of running water , the grapes grow toward the music ' s source. And while Cignozzi likes to play Mozart  another award-winning vineyard in South Africa is also set on playing classical music to its grapes , even in its cellars , reports the Australian Financial Review  Mancuso says it is the frequencies , not the composer , that matter , and that even heavy metal would produce the effects.

The International Organisation of Vine and Wine ( OIV ) has estimated that output will reach 259.5m hectolitres ( mhl ) this year , making 2016 one of the lowest production years in the past two decades. While the amount of wine produced should meet consumer demand , the figures are a reminder of how global warming and natural climate variability are having a profound effect on wine , and perhaps where it will be grown in future. Italy is expected to produce the most wine in 2016 , followed by France , Spain , the US , Australia and China. France is likely to remain in the top three , despite a predicted 12 % drop in production to 41.9mhl. The most precipitous declines are set to be in South America , a potential source of concern for fans of the malbec and carmnre varieties. Production is estimated to have plummeted by 35 % in Argentina and 21 % in Chile , the seventh-biggest producer. South Africa is set to report a 19 % fall , but the news is better for Australia and New Zealand , which are expected to increase production by 5 % and 35 % respectively. The New Zealand figures would put it near a record it set in 2014. The OIV said the predicted overall decline was strongly affected by climatic events. The El Nio climate phenomenon seems to be back in Latin America , where production was affected by fairly exceptional weather , with lots of rain ,  said OIV  s chief executive , Jean-Marie Aurand. El Nio , which occurs every four to five years , affects rainfall patterns and causes both drought and flooding. A report released earlier this year by the Earth Institute at Columbia University said warming temperatures , the main driver of grape harvest timing , have significantly pushed these periods forward globally. Across the world , scientists have found that each degree centigrade of warming pushes grape harvests forward roughly six or seven days ,  the report said. This phenomenon could eventually make pinot noir grapes unsuitable for many parts of Burgundy , according to a 2011 study by the climate scientist Yves Tourre. A 2014 paper in journal Wine Economics and Policy concluded that rising temperatures would have an extraordinary effect  on agriculture and there were few crops more susceptible than grapes to minor changes in climate. In Europe , the paper pointed to a potential chilling of the Bordeaux region and parts of Spain , due to the loss of the Gulf Stream , while other regions , including Alsace , are expected to get warmer and experience shorter growth seasons. In the Italian region of Chianti , grapes have begun ripening too early , leading to possible future changes in wine varieties ."
152,"The three largest shareholders in GameStop , the video game retailer at the center of a frenzied duel between Wall Street and small investors , have made more than $ 2bn from the company  s astronomic recent share rise. Stock in the company continued its vertiginous rise on Wednesday , hitting a fresh 52-week high of $ 354.83 , making the 13 % stake held by Ryan Cohen , 34 , GameStop  s largest single shareholder , worth more than $ 1.3bn. Over the past two weeks , according to CNBC , Cohen  s net worth increased an average of $ 90m a day , or nearly $ 4m per hour , as GameStop stock has surged more than 1,550 % this year alone. Other winners include Donald Foss , the 76-year-old founder and former CEO of Credit Acceptance Corp , a subprime auto lender. Foss bought 5 % of GameStop early last year for about $ 12m. His stake is now worth more than $ 500m. GameStop  s chief executive , George Sherman , has seen his 3.4 % stake jump to a value of about $ 350m. On Reddit , where many of the small investors have strategized over their investments , small investors too have boasted of their outside gains from beating Wall Street. But some in Wall Street are also making huge gains. BlackRock , the world  s largest asset manager , owned 9.2m shares in GameStop at the end of December , according to a regulatory filing. If it still holds all those shares , they were worth more than $ 3bn on Wednesday. The gains comes as thousands of small investors have poured into the stock and forced Wall Street hedge funds , including Melvin Capital and Citron , which were betting on GameStop  s collapse , to take billions in losses. The trading frenzy over GameStop drew comment from the incoming Biden administration on Wednesday with the treasury and other regulators announcing they were monitoring the situation. Cohen was a catalyst in the company  s phenomenal share price rise. Last year the investor and founder of Chewy , an online retailer of pet products , bought a stake in GameStop and launched a campaign for the company to move faster into the digital age to compete with Amazon. In January Cohen and two allies joined GameStop  s board. Despite the record rise in the company  s share price it is still planning to close up to 450 stores this year. On Wednesday evening , the Reddit message board that drove the GameStop stock surges was briefly made private. The page also said it had experienced an unprecedented  scale of interest and was facing technical difficulties. Separately , the online gaming platform Discord said it had removed the WallStreetBets server from its platform for violating its guidelines on hate speech and spreading misinformation. Discord said it had issued multiple warnings to the server admin before banning it .|||||Melvin Capital closed out its short position in GameStop on Tuesday afternoon after taking a huge loss , the hedge fund ' s manager told CNBC ' s Andrew Ross Sorkin. GameStop , hedge funds ' most-hated stock , was targeted by an army of retail investors who marshaled forces against short sellers in online chat rooms. In the Reddit forum "" wallstreetbets "" with more than 2 million subscribers , rookie investors encouraged each other to pile into GameStop ' s shares and call options , creating massive short squeezes in the stock. CNBC could not confirm the amount of losses Melvin Capital took on the short position. Citadel and Point72 have infused close to $ 3 billion into Gabe Plotkin ' s hedge fund to shore up its finances. On Wednesday ' s "" Squawk Box , "" Sorkin said Plotkin told him that speculation about a bankruptcy filing is false. GameStop shares have soared more than 400 % this week alone to $ 347.51 apiece , driving its January gains to 685 % . The stock was worth just $ 6 four months ago. Shares of the brick-and-mortar video game retailer popped another 134 % on Wednesday , pushing the company ' s market cap to $ 24 billion. GameStop was the single most traded name in the U.S. stock market on Tuesday , topping Tesla and Apple , even though they are 81 and 233 times larger in market cap terms , according to Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid .|||||It ' s "" a head-scratching David and Goliath story , "" as the AP puts it , and Elon Musk on Tuesday lobbed a rock in the giant ' s direction. Musk tweeted a single word , "" Gamestonk ! ! ""  and it was enough to send GameStop ' s share price temporarily over the $ 200 mark in after-hours trading. This after the stock closed at $ 148 a share Tuesday , no small feat when you consider the video game retailer was trading at less than $ 18 a few weeks back. So what ' s going on ? Well , those Davids and Goliaths. The latter are investors who ' ve watched GameStop inch toward its potential demise as more games move online : Over the last 12 quarters the company has lost $ 1.6 billion , and investors who thought the stock would keep sinking shorted the stock. The only way they profit in that scenario is if the share price keeps falling , and that ' s what investors tied to the WallStreetBets subreddit are trying to make sure doesn ' t happen  so far with success. story continues below CNET explains that the subreddit ' s members decided to quickly snatch up shares , which moves the price up.

153,"Both House and Senate Republicans had included the exemption in their tax plan drafts , with little controversy or debate. &#124; Zach Gibson/Getty Images Newman ' s Own faces mammoth tax bill after lawmakers fail to spare the foundation A decision by the Senate  s parliamentarian could force the sale of the late actor Paul Newman  s food company , and dismantle his charity. During the Senate  s consideration of Republicans  plans to rewrite the tax code , Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough struck a provision that would have spared Newman  s Own from an unusual 200 percent tax it  s facing. It had been seeking the provision for eight years , and appeared to be finally on the cusp of victory. Both House and Senate Republicans had included the exemption in their tax plan drafts , with little controversy or debate. But MacDonough deemed the provision  along with more than a dozen others  to be violations of the Senate  s rules , so they were deleted before the legislation was passed last week. It came as a total bolt out of the blue ,  said Bob Forrester , head of the foundation that owns the food company. He says he was unfamiliar with the rule. It was a stunning , devastating , brutal even , notification when I had heard this had happened.  We  re still stunned ,  he said. The IRS has given the foundation until November 2018 before the tax ax will fall. But given the time it takes to sell a company , Forrester says he needs a fix by the end of the first quarter of next year or it will have to begin divesting from the business , which sells salad dressing , dog food , salsa , wine and popcorn , among other things. When Newman , one of the biggest movie stars of the 20th century , died in 2008 , he left the company to his foundation , which gives away its profits to charity.

The problem is a 1969 tax law that bars foundations from owning more than a small stake in private businesses. It was written with an eye toward preventing wealthy people from using foundations as tax shelters , and it imposes a deliberately confiscatory 200 percent tax on those that don  t unload their businesses after a certain period of time. Forrester had won support from lawmakers in both parties for the exemption , including Sens. John Thune ( R-S.D. ) and Bob Menendez ( D-N.J. ) . But the parliamentarian , responsible for interpreting the Senate  s rules , called it a violation of the so-called Byrd rule. Named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd , the rule puts strict limitations on what sort of provisions can be included in reconciliation  measures like the one Republicans are now using to muscle their tax plans through the Senate. MacDonough also killed a bid by a handful of Senate Republicans to include a trigger mechanism that would have forced future tax increases if the GOP plan didn  t help the economy as much as lawmakers hope  which briefly brought negotiations over the tax legislation to a standstill. She deleted more than a dozen other provisions as well , including one allowing education savings accounts for unborn children , tax breaks for people hit by flooding in the Mississippi Delta and one for tax-preparation programs for poor people. That has frustrated those who had been pushing the provisions , and say they have little recourse to challenge the parliamentarian  s decisions. She could be overruled by lawmakers , though that would be highly unusual. Ironically , Forrester said lawmakers had advised him to wait to make another run at the foundation provision until lawmakers took up a broad tax-code rewrite , saying that would be his best opportunity to get it approved. Forrester says he  s still looking for ways to get the provision passed , though he may have missed his best opportunity. He acknowledges time is running short. I continue to hope there is some other option ,  he said. I just can  t believe there isn  t.  If there is no option legislatively , then there is no option for Newman  s Own other than to break itself up . |||||Paul Newman , the Academy-Award winning actor who personified cool as an activist , race car driver , popcorn impresario and the anti-hero of such films as Hud , Cool Hand Luke and The Color of Money , has died after a long battle with cancer , the AP reports.

154,"NEW SALEM It  s hard to make out in the thicket of trees maybe a hundred yards to the north of Highway 218 , but it  s there : a Hyundai Elantra , hanging nose down , as if caught in a spiderweb. By mid-morning Monday , as the sun peeked out for the first time since Florence came in from the coast late last week , the field of soybeans between the road and the strung-up sedan looked as if someone had simply left a sprinkler system on too long. Fourteen hours earlier , though , the rains had turned normally serene Richardson Creek into a raging monster , water churning 10 feet above those soybean plants and sweeping the Hyundai  carrying young mother Dazia Lee and her 1-year-old son Kaiden Lee Welch  off the road , across the field , and into the trees. Authorities said Lee and her toddler were traveling from their Charlotte home to visit family in Wadesboro on Sunday night , and that State Highway Patrol had put barricades beyond the intersection at Fish Road , to warn of trouble ahead. When she got there , I saw people coming in and out ,  Lee told WCNC on Monday. I was about to detour , but I stopped and I saw cars coming in and out , so I thought ( it was OK ) .

I can tell you that the barricades were up there ,  Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said Monday at a press conference at the New Salem Volunteer Fire Department. Whether someone else moved those barricades and she drove around em , I can  t say.  Police said that at about 8 p.m. Sunday , Lee came up to a bridge that crosses the creek , and tried to continue driving , though the road was partially submerged. The powerful current then swept the car over the flooded field and into the trees , police said. Once it was lodged in place , Lee worked her way out of the driver  s seat and freed Kaiden from his child seat. By that point , most of the car was under water. As I understand it , she can  t swim ,  Cathey said. She was able to get out herself , but she couldn  t get her feet on the ground. The water was still over her head , and she was just struggling.  $ 2 for 2 months Subscribe for unlimited access to our website , app , eEdition and more CLAIM OFFER Through sobs , not long after she was plucked from the river , Lee told a reporter for Fox Charlotte : I was holding his hand , trying to hold him , trying to pull him up. And it got to the point I couldn  t hold on anymore  and he let go.  Multiple state and local law enforcement agencies  as well as an Urban Search and Rescue Team from Miami-Dade County , deployed by FEMA  searched the water till past midnight , police said. Darkness , and the volume and intensity of the water , thwarted them. They resumed the search at 7 : 30 Monday morning , police said. By that point , the water  which Sunday night had been hundreds of yards wide ( Richardson Creek is normally 30 to 40 feet , from bank to bank )  had receded considerably. Evidence of its destructiveness remained : Of three large dumpsters in a parking lot by the bridge , one was still in place and one was a few hundred feet downriver. The third ? We don  t know where it is ,  Cathey said. Closer to where Lee  s car was swept away , a large section of asphalt had eroded in a matter of hours. This was one of 28 roads in Union County that were deemed impassable and blocked off during the height of the storm Sunday , a county spokesperson said. I  ve worked this county 40 years ,  Cathey said. I  ve never seen flooding of this magnitude.  On Monday morning , TV news crews arrived before dawn , waiting for word of young Kaiden. Just after 10 a.m. , as a news helicopter dipped low to document the scene , two rescue workers came into view carrying the boy  s body , beneath a white sheet , back through the soybean fields. As it turned out , Kaiden was right next to the car. The dark and the floodwater had hidden him. The child was actually found ... between the bumper of the vehicle and tree ,  City of Miami Fire Chief Joseph Zahralban , head of the USAR team , told members of the media. With the turbulent water and the hydraulics ... the water places a lot of pressure on that vehicle and anything around it. So the child was essentially held down between the vehicle and the tree.  The ordeal clearly affected first responders. As a father myself ,  New Salem assistant fire chief Chad Rorie began to say at the press conference , before pausing. He spent several seconds trying to collect himself , and when he began again , his voice hitched. That  s not something we want to go to any day of the week.  Cathey reiterated how tragic the circumstances were , while also reminding people to take cautions seriously during severe-weather events. Driving through water where the roads are closed is dangerous for anybody ,  he said. High water is high water.  But when a reporter asked whether Lee would face criminal charges if it were found she ignored the barricades , Cathey said it was up to the State Highway Patrol , which would conduct an investigation. And as reporters and first responders stared off across the field , at the Hyundai on its nose amongst the trees , a few people quietly said that Dazia Lee had probably already been punished enough.

Earthquake lights were reported shortly before a devastating quake struck L ' Aquila , Italy , in 2009. Credit : Marco Equizi/Flickr/Getty Images A new catalogue of earthquake lights  mysterious glows sometimes reported before or during seismic shaking  finds that they happen most often in geological rift environments , where the ground is pulling apart. The work is the latest to tackle the enigmatic lights , which have been described by eyewitnesses for centuries but are yet to be fully explained by scientists1,2,3. The study , published in the January/February issue of Seismological Research Letters4 , pulls together several strands of research to propose a mechanism by which earthquake lights form. The authors suggest that , during an earthquake , the stress of rocks grinding against each other generates electric charges , which travel upwards along the nearly vertical geological faults that are common in rift zones. When the charges reach Earth ' s surface and interact with the atmosphere , they create a glow. Earthquake lights are a real phenomenon  they  re not UFOs ,  says lead author Robert Thriault , a geologist at Quebec  s Ministry of Natural Resources in Quebec City , Canada. They can be scientifically explained.  On the fringe One of the problems in studying earthquake lights is that legitimate reports become entangled with fringe science. Some witnesses improbably describe flames and smoke spurting out of the ground ; others mention glowing clouds that could be an aurora , or streaks of heavenly fire that could be meteors. But some reports cannot be easily explained away , says John Ebel , a geophysicist at Boston College in Massachusetts. In 1727 , for instance , a New England man walking his dog one October evening felt the ground start to shake and watched a ball of light roll onto the animal , which yelped. We  re all interested in finding out more about earthquake lights ,  says Ebel , who was not involved in the new study. It  s just not a regular area of scientific inquiry , because there  s no way to do an experiment on them.  Thriault  s team decided to compile all the reliable reports they could find , from the year 1600 to today. They focused on 27 earthquakes from the Americas and 38 from Europe , and sorted through many bizarre tales. Off the Peruvian coast in August 2007 , a fisherman reported the sky turning violet a few minutes before the sea began shaking. Near Ebingen , Germany , in November 1911 , a woman reported seeing glows that moved along the ground like snakes  as a quake began. Of the 65 earthquakes studied , 56 occurred along an active or ancient rift zone. And 63 of the 65 quakes took place where the geological faults that ruptured were almost vertical  as opposed to the shallower angles that many major faults take. This steep geometry could explain how earthquake lights appear , Thriault and his colleagues say. Team member Friedemann Freund , a mineral physicist at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , California , suspects it all starts with defects in a rock , where oxygen atoms inside a mineral  s chemical structure are missing an electron. When the stress of an earthquake hits the rock , it breaks chemical bonds involved in these defects , creating holes of positive electrical charge. These ' p holes ' flow can vertically through the fault to the surface , triggering strong local electric fields that can generate light. Big squeeze Laboratory experiments have shown that electric fields can be generated in certain types of rock by squeezing5. But Freund  s idea is just one of many possible mechanisms to explain earthquake lights. It makes enough sense , but that doesn  t mean that it  s right ,  Ebel says. The catalogue opens up other ideas for studying earthquake lights , says Thriault. For instance , seismologists who monitor active faults might look for changes in the soil  s electrical conductivity immediately before or during a quake. More generally , spreading the word about earthquake lights could raise awareness about them as a possible quake warning , says Thriault. The phenomenon has alerted people before : near L  Aquila , Italy , in April 2009 , a man saw white flashes reflecting off his kitchen furniture in the early hours of the morning and took his family outside to safety6. Two hours later , a devastating earthquake struck. References 1 Lockner , D. A. , Johnston , M. J. S. &amp; Byerlee , J. D. Nature 302 , 28-33 ( 1983 ) . 2 Derr , J. S.

Welcome to springtime in the Rockies and parts of the Great Plains. It ' s not unusual for floods , snow and fire to co-exist in the Rockies thanks to powerful storms blowing through the mountains , melting snow swelling waterways and high winds sweeping across dry grasslands and trees that haven ' t seen their first green shoots and leaves. What is unusual is a storm system that is moving in from the Pacific Ocean and forecast to intensify inland. A bomb cyclone is a rapid drop in air pressure  at least 24 millibars in 24 hours  and often is over or near oceans or seas because it requires warm moist air smacking into cold dry air , along with volatile weather from the jet stream. The central and mountain parts of the country may get one of these every few winters , said Greg Carbin , forecast branch chief for the National Weather Service ' s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland. The March 13 storm fit that definition and caused massive flooding in the Midwest , a blizzard in Colorado and Wyoming , and produced winds between 96 mph and 110 mph. This week ' s storm is expected to be similar in intensity and in snowfall , but will likely fall short of the "" bomb cyclone "" designation , meteorologists said. CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli said on CBSN that it will become a "" monster storm "" when it hits the Plains. "" We ' re talking a blockbuster blizzard , "" Berardelli said. He expected it to start hitting the northern Plains on Wednesday and then slowly move across the region for at least two days. Heavy , wet snow will fall from the Nebraska panhandle through south central and southeastern South Dakota into western Minnesota. Wind speeds can reach 50 mph to 60 mph across Kansas. "" This blizzard will further exacerbate flooding in Nebraska with the added insult of heavy snowfall to eventually melt , "" said Ryan Maue , a meteorologist at the private weathermodels.com. "" This is more bad news for suffering farmers who are unable to flip the calendar on winter. "" But first , the storm is expected to cause flooding in Idaho and western Montana , and dump up to 2 feet of snow in the mountains of Montana and Wyoming as it moves in from the Pacific Ocean. Parts of Colorado that were under a fire warning Monday are expected to see snow and temperature drops of more than 40 degrees by Wednesday at the southern edge of the storm , meteorologists said. The storm dumped rain on parts of Oregon Sunday and Monday as it moved inland , causing flooding that closed some schools in the central Willamette Valley and forced the release of water from dams. While it ' s unusual to see two consecutive storms this intense , it ' s difficult to pin the cause on climate change , Colorado state climatologist Russ Schumacher said Monday. "" I think it ' s an interesting question to ask whether there ' s some climate change fingerprint on this , "" he said. "" But it ' s a complicated puzzle to piece together. "" That includes what is happening as the storm forms over the Pacific Ocean , what happens once it ' s over land and what effect climate change may have on those variables. "" I ' m not sure we have the answer , "" Schumacher said. Typical conditions for the Rockies are what drove a wildfire Sunday on southeastern Montana ' s Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation , where a house fire sparked a blaze that quickly burned through 1,700 acres of dry grass and trees. It forced evacuations Sunday in Lame Deer , a town of about 2,000 people that is the seat of the tribal government , before fire crews were able to contain it. Also normal are the fire warnings issued for eastern Colorado on Monday , a day after a wildfire near Colorado Springs forced the temporary evacuation of about 20 homes. Forecasters frequently issue red flag warnings for March and April on the eastern and southeastern Colorado plains as the jet stream moves southward and brings stronger weather systems and higher wind , said Jennifer Stark , meteorologist in charge for the National Weather Service in Pueblo , Colorado. "" This is the time of year when we get a roller coaster of weather , "" Schumacher said. "" Going from 80 degree temperatures one day to a snowstorm the next is not that out of the ordinary , especially in March and April , around here . ""|||||Short Range Public Discussion ( Latest Discussion - Issued 1954Z Oct 28 , 2021 )|||||National Guard troops are using specialized vehicles with tank-like treads to rescue stranded drivers in Colorado in the wake of a massive late-winter storm that is expected to unleash heavy rain and snow on the Midwest plains on Thursday.

160,"The Lafayette city-parish government is suing the person behind satirical antifa Facebook events that authorities responded to this summer in River Ranch and at the Acadiana Mall. The lawsuit , filed Monday , says that these hoaxes have cost taxpayers a considerable amount as law enforcement investigate and respond to each. The lawsuit also points to fake antifa events in small cities across the country that , even after being debunked by local leaders , have sometimes prompted local citizens to use guns to "" guard their cities. "" Defendant John Merrifield says the lawsuit takes social media posts out-of-context and misconstrues his motivations. Merrifield , who turns 29 next week , said he ' s using satire and his digital platform as a form of activism and protest. "" It ' s to expose how out-of-order their priorities are in regards to how they protect the rich versus how they protect the poor , "" Merrifield said in a phone interview. "" And then , more recently , it ' s in regards to how the city is not doing anything that matters to the people  the murder , the extrajudicial killing of Trayford Pellerin  that matters to people. People want answers , and the city is being very dismissive of that. "" Merrifield learned of the lawsuit Thursday morning when he was contacted by a reporter. He said he ' s seeking legal representation , but he doesn ' t think the lawsuit has merit. "" I think it ' s absolutely ridiculous that they are trying to sue me over this , "" Merrifield said. "" And let me just check my bank account real quick. OK , yeah , they can have all 300 of my dollars. I have $ 300 to my name , and they can have it. "" The city-parish government is seeking an unspecified amount from Merrifield for damages of less than $ 75,000. Lafayette Mayor-President Josh Guillory mentioned the lawsuit during his Thursday morning radio show on KPEL 96.5 FM after a caller asked who was footing the bill for overtime worked by law enforcement responding to these kinds of events. "" We will always take these threats seriously , "" Guillory said during the segment. "" But we ' re not just going to respond and say , ' OK , thank you , ' you know , ' Let us pay all this overtime from the taxpayers. ' Heck no. We will stop at no cost  or we will stop at no measure  to recoup the cost that taxpayers have to pay for this kind of stuff. "" Throughout the radio segment , Guillory repeated this message : "" Our community will not tolerate civil unrest. "" Demonstrators from Lafayette and the surrounding area have clashed with Guillory and other local officials in the aftermath of Pellerin ' s Aug. 21 death at the hands of Lafayette Police. Pellerin , 31 , was shot by officers at a gas station along the Northwest Evangeline Thruway. Louisiana State Police investigators said Pellerin was armed with a knife and was approaching the door of the convenience store when he was shot. Officers had trailed him for a half mile after responding to a disturbance call and deploying tasers , which were ineffective , state police said. Several protests have since taken place across the city , with some of those ending in confrontation between demonstrators and law enforcement. Merrifield ' s first satirical event , "" ANTIFA takes River Ranch , "" was posted to Facebook in July , before protests against police brutality and racial inequality hit so close to home. The fake event had "" its intended effect "" by prompting a counter protest event by the Right Side Millennial , according to the lawsuit.

The mall closed early that day , and more than 30 police units were in the parking lot at the scheduled start time for the Facebook event. The lawsuit says Merrifield "" gleefully "" followed the coverage of these events and "" seemed to take pride in his ' trolling. ' "" The suit also alleges that Merrifield has "" sought to profit off the havoc he created "" through creating and selling an "" Acadianatifa "" flag , which incorporates antifa symbols into the Acadiana flag. Merrifield has denied that claim , saying the proceeds from sales of the flag and other merchandise have actually been used to compensate mall employees who reached out to him in frustration over lost wages because of Saturday ' s "" event. "" Earlier this week , after the lawsuit was filed but before Merrifield learned of it , he created another satirical event , "" ANTIFA Takes Laura. "" This time , the Facebook event ' s location is Lafayette City Hall.

161,"AMBRIDGE , Pa. ( KDKA/AP )  Approximately 190 Ambridge Area School District teachers are on strike. Schools are closed Tuesday after educators in the Beaver County district walked off the job following months of contract negotiations. The school board and teachers  union remain at odds over salaries and health benefits. The board has made what we believe to be a very fair salary offer , which includes compensation beyond the increases in the salary scale ,  Ambridge Area School District solicitor Ira Weiss said. The district has also made a very realistic proposal on the teachers  contribution to health care.  A last-ditch marathon negotiation session between Ambridge Area School District and a teacher  s union took place behind auditorium doors Monday. Around 9 : 15 p.m. , it was announced that negotiations had broken down and that teachers would be going on strike. The teachers  contract expired in June 2015. The District , if you read what is on their website , have seemed to dig their heels in and claiming that our proposals are going to bankrupt them , while in reality our proposals are very reasonable ,  Chris Konkus with the Ambridge Area Education Association said. The District says it is in a very severe financial situation , facing a $ 1.5 million deficit. It says it will be very difficult to fund the proposal it has already made , let alone any increase. The state Education Department decided Wednesday that teachers must return to work on Jan. 4. So far , no new talks are scheduled.

The teachers were walking the picket lines near Ambridge High School on Duss Avenue when several of them noticed a cloud of smoke rising in the sky about a block awake. Karen DeMarco put down her strike poster , ran to the home and started pounding on the front door. I just see her spring across the road , almost get hit by a car ,  said teacher Jeff Morovich , who was also on the picket line. Then I see a resident coming down 8th Street yelling , Call 911.   The teachers didn  t wait for firefighters to arrive. They knocked down a door and went into the home. We found the lady of the house sitting in the one room , and there was several oxygen tanks there ,  DeMarco said. We felt that we needed to get her out with the oxygen tanks. There was a daughter there and a grandfather there.  Two other teachers carried out the oxygen tanks before they had a chance to explode. When firefighters arrived , flames were coming from the roof , but three people who lived in the home were safe. Because power lines were in the way of ladder trucks , Duquesne Light was called to shut off power to the area. About 50 homes were affected. A warming center was set up at the Ambridge Fire Station , but the borough manager told [ Channel 11  s Damany Lewis ] that nobody used the shelter. When things settled down , DeMarco said she recognized one of the people she helped to save. Kayla  s a former student of mine , and I just felt that I had to do something to get that family out ,  she said. I  d do that for anybody. I just wanted to see them safe for the holiday season.

162,"It  s official : California is 100 % drought-free. For the first time since 2011 , the state shows no areas suffering from prolonged drought and illustrates almost entirely normal conditions , according to a map released Thursday by the U.S. Drought Monitor. Former Gov. Jerry Brown issued an executive order in 2017 that lifted the drought emergency in most of the state , leaving some breathing a sigh of relief. But he cautioned Californians to keep saving water as some parts of the state were still suffering from extreme drought. Now , two years later , that deficit seems to have been erased , thanks to an exceptionally wet winter. Advertisement The reservoirs are full , lakes are full , the streams are flowing , there  s tons of snow ,  said Jessica Blunden , a climate scientist with the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All the drought is officially gone.  The Drought Monitor , which collects data from scientists from the National Drought Mitigation Center , the U.S. Department of Agriculture and dozens of weather agencies , last showed a drought map that was clear in December 2011. In updating the map , scientists consult with hydrologists , water managers , meteorologists and other experts to determine the amount of water in the state  s reservoirs , the snowpack level and other key measurements. With the wet winter streak going strong , their reports have been good. In January , storms filled up many of the state  s water reserves almost to capacity and added about 580 billion gallons of water to reservoirs across the state. That month , the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada , a major source of California  s water supply , doubled  and then doubled again in February. California has been getting a tremendous amount of rain , storms and snow ,  Blunden said. It  s just been extremely wet and it  s been so wet  that we  ve been able to alleviate drought across the state.  A year ago , just 11 % of the state was experiencing normal conditions while 88.9 % of the state was abnormally dry ,  according to the drought report. Some parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties were still colored dark red , meaning they were experiencing extreme drought.  Even last week , a small portion of Northern California was labeled as having moderate drought  conditions. But as of Thursday , 93 % of the state was experiencing normal conditions and none of it was in drought , Blunden said. Small portions in the far northern and southern parts of the state were still marked as abnormally dry ,  but elsewhere , the map registered no drought conditions at all. In San Diego County , reservoirs were only 65 % full , which contributed to the dry conditions in that area , Blunden said. And conditions are expected to return to normal next week in Northern California , she said. With another storm expected within a week in San Diego , that area also would likely come out of its dry spell entirely. After a cold winter in Southern California , the Santa Ana winds are returning , while a high pressure system will help raise the temperatures , said Jimmy Taeger , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The winter chill set records in downtown Los Angeles , which recorded its coldest February in nearly 60 years. There had never been a February since July 1877 , when record-keeping began in downtown L.A. , that the temperature failed to reach the 70-degree mark. In contrast , the highs for this weekend in the Los Angeles area are expected to hit 78. In San Diego , the mercury could reach 75 degrees Sunday for the first time since late January. The warm weather is rolling into the region on strong winds. In Los Angeles , the weather service issued a wind advisory Thursday morning , noting that winds between 15 and 25 mph would roll through , with gusts up to 40 mph from Malibu to the Hollywood Hills. Temperatures might be creeping up , but as for the rain , Taeger said we  re not completely over with it yet.  Offshore winds will subside , bringing a 40 % chance of a storm coming through San Diego over Wednesday and Thursday. Next weekend will bring more warm temperatures , but another storm could materialize toward the end of March , forecasters said. The rainy trend has extended across the United States , making for vast improvements in drought conditions , especially in the Western part of the country. Colorado , New Mexico and Wyoming , for example , have made significant progress , though much of those states are still classified as abnormally dry and are still experiencing drought conditions , Blunden said. But storms are raging in some areas. A blizzard is moving over Colorado and Arizona , and New Mexico on Wednesday had heavy thunderstorms , which could significantly alleviate drought conditions in the next few weeks. Californians have a lot to be happy about , she said , but Blunden warned that could change. Dry conditions can easily creep back in ,  she said. That  s why we adjust the map every week. The conditions change  and they can change fast sometimes.  Brown  s declaration was made after record rainfall in 2017. Then , in 2018 , the state broke more records following an extremely dry winter. We did see such major drought for five years ,  Blunden said. All of these storms came along and alleviated the drought. Everybody thought we were out of the woods , but then it came right back. I think drought conditions can sneak up on you very quickly. It is good to be cautious and always think about conserving water.  alejandra.reyesvelarde@latimes.com Twitter : @r_valejandra|||||California is officially free of drought after more than seven years , drought monitors said Thursday.

Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought , although 7 percent of the state remains "" abnormally dry. "" "" The storms this year have really helped snowpacks , the reservoirs , "" said Jessica Blunden , a climatologist with NOAA ' s National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off , she said. This winter  the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February  has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895 , with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches , which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average , Blunden said. That precipitation has not just benefited California. "" It  s been a great winter for the West , "" she said. The U.S. Drought Monitor website , which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center , says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs , and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state. The Los Angeles area experienced cool winter temperatures that brought the fifth-longest streak of 41 consecutive days with a high temperature below 70 degrees since records began in 1877.

A campaign also urged drivers to "" go dirty for the drought "" and to not wash their vehicles. Brown lifted the drought emergency in most of California in 2017 , warning "" the next drought could be around the corner. "" He added that "" conservation must remain a way of life. "" Some parts of Southern California remain "" abnormally dry due to very dry previous years , "" the U.S. Drought Monitor said on its website. Reservoirs in San Diego County are at 65 percent capacity , and Big Bear Lake was down 18 feet in early March , but levels are expected to rise , it said in weekly drought summary. The areas listed as abnormally dry were in the southern part of the state , including parts of Orange , Riverside , San Diego and Imperial counties , as well as a small portion in the northern part of the state in Siskiyou County along the Oregon border , according to the drought monitor. In December , 75 percent of California was in "" moderate drought , "" up from 47 percent in March , according to the monitor. Conditions can change that quickly , and they can change back to dry conditions as well , Blunden said.

166,"Consumers could see some relief from higher food prices by late fall , if the latest government crop forecast holds up. The US Agriculture Department predicted today that corn production will total 14.8 billion bushels , with a record yield of 166 bushels per acre. That compares with 12.4 billion bushels a year ago. story continues below A hot , dry summer could decrease those numbers , but if the prediction proves true , corn prices will fall and that likely will mean lower supermarket prices for products such as cereal and soft drinks sweetened with corn syrup. Beef and pork prices could fall , too , because producers would pay less to feed their animals.

( Read more food prices stories. )|||||This is a moving target ,  said Darrel L. Good , a professor emeritus of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. But what we know is this : There  s been some permanent and substantive yield reduction already , and we  re on the cusp , depending on the weather , of taking that down quite a bit more.  In its most recent assessment , released on Monday , the Department of Agriculture reported that 48 percent of corn crops nationally were in good or excellent condition , a drop from 56 percent of crops a week earlier. In some states , though , the circumstances were far worse. In Indiana , half of corn crops were designated poor or very poor , and in Illinois , another state among the nation  s top corn producers , only 26 percent of crops were considered good or excellent. John Hawkins , a spokesman for the Illinois Farm Bureau , said those in the southernmost sections of his state are close to or past that point of no return ,  while elsewhere , there  s a lot of praying ; it  s hanging on by a thread.  These 100-degree temperatures are just sucking the life out of everything ,  he said. American farmers had high expectations for corn this year , planting 96.4 million acres of it  a number 5 percent more than the previous year. High prices and an expectation of strong returns made this year  s planting the largest corn acreage in 75 years. Those were heady times in farm country , with farmland prices rising on and on , even as the recovery moved sluggishly in other realms. An uncharacteristically warm March in the Midwest sent hopes still higher , allowing farmers to plant corn weeks earlier than usual. For some crops , including some cherries in Michigan and apples in Indiana , unexpected April frosts then caused damage , but the corn , said Randy Anderson , a farmer in Southern Illinois , went right along beautifully. And then very little rain fell , and temperatures soared. By last week around corn country , scores of triple-digit heat records were being broken : Jefferson County , Mo. , 111 degrees ; Evansville , Ind. , 107 degrees. That left corn , including Mr. Anderson  s crop , shriveling. We  re talking five-feet-tall corn with no ears , no shoots and no tassels ,  he said. It wears on your nerves to even look.  For much of the region , the next few weeks  as the plants  tassels shed pollen to fertilize the silks and create kernels  are crucial. The endless fields of soybeans are at risk in the Midwestern heat , too , though they are seen as more resilient and able to pollinate later. But a stressed , withered corn plant may not pollinate at all. This is a very narrow window for corn , and there  s little room for error ,  said Brad Rippey , an agricultural meteorologist for the United States Department of Agriculture. Whatever happens in that window , it is what it is  that cob is made or broken . "
167,"Huge quantities of contaminated water from the Fukushima power plant could end up in the Pacific Ocean , or so suggests Japan ' s environment minister. Fukushima has accumulated more than 1 million tons of water containing tritium , a radioactive isotope of hydrogen , as roughly 110 tons of groundwater each day reach damaged reactor buildings to mix with water used to keep fuel cores from melting , reports the Guardian. But with storage space expected to be depleted by summer 2022 , "" the only option will be to drain it into the sea and dilute it , "" Yoshiaki Harada said Tuesday , noting "" the whole of the government will discuss this.

But fishermen in particular fear the effects of Harada ' s suggestion on an industry that ' s just beginning to bounce back. Even South Korea is concerned , with its foreign ministry asking Japan to make "" a wise and prudent decision on the issue , "" per Reuters. The outlet notes tritium is thought to be "" relatively harmless , "" while the Guardian explains that "" coastal nuclear plants commonly dump water that contains tritium into the ocean. "" But Fukushima operator Tokyo Electric Power said last year that the water stored in nearly 1,000 tanks contained other contaminants , too. Experts will weigh in before any decision is made. ( Tritium was previously leaked in Florida and New York. )|||||TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Nearly a decade after the Fukushima nuclear disaster , Japan  s government has decided to release over one million tonnes of contaminated water into the sea , media reports said on Friday , with a formal announcement expected to be made later this month. The decision is expected to rankle neighbouring countries like South Korea , which has already stepped up radiation tests of food from Japan , and further devastate the fishing industry in Fukushima that has battled against such a move for years. The disposal of contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi plant has been a longstanding problem for Japan as it proceeds with an decades-long decommissioning project. Nearly 1.2 million tonnes of contaminated water are currently stored in huge tanks at the facility. The plant , run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc 9501.T , suffered multiple nuclear meltdowns after a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. On Friday , Japan  s industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said no decision had been made on the disposal of the water yet , but the government aims to make one quickly. To prevent any delays in the decommissioning process , we need to make a decision quickly ,  he told a news conference. He did not give any further details , including a time-frame. Slideshow ( 3 images ) The Asahi newspaper reported that any such release is expected to take at around two years to prepare , as the site  s irradiated water first needs to pass through a filtration process before it can be further diluted with seawater and finally released into the ocean. In 2018 , Tokyo Electric apologised after admitting its filtration systems had not removed all dangerous material from the water , collected from the cooling pipes used to keep fuel cores from melting when the plant was crippled. It has said it plans to remove all radioactive particles from the water except tritium , an isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate and is considered to be relatively harmless. It is common practice for nuclear plants around the world to release water that contain traces of tritium into the ocean. In April , a team sent by the International Atomic Energy Agency to review contaminated water issues at the Fukushima site said the options for water disposal outlined by an advisory committee in Japan - vapour release and discharges to the sea  were both technically feasible. The IAEA said both options were used by operating nuclear plants. Last week , Japanese fish industry representatives urged the government to not allow the release of contaminated water from the Fukushima plant into the sea , saying it would undo years of work to restore their reputation. South Korea has retained a ban on imports of seafood from the Fukushima region that was imposed after the nuclear disaster and summoned a senior Japanese embassy official last year to explain how Tokyo planned to deal with the Fukushima water problem. During Tokyo  s bid to host the Olympic Games in 2013 , then-prime minister Shinzo Abe told members of the International Olympic Committee that the Fukushima facility was under control  . The Games have been delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic and some events are due to be held as close as 60 km ( 35 miles ) from the wrecked plant ."
168,"|||||Here  s how the news works circa 2015 : A story gets reported , usually by journalists for major media outlets like the Associated Press or The New York Times. Then , when it starts to get traction on social media and shows up in your Twitter feed or your Facebook , the aggregators jump on it. Aggregators are human vultures with lots of student loan debt who put their own particular spin on someone else  s story by turning it into a listicle or writing a clever reaction piece or reducing a 3,000-word feature into a meme. I am one of those vultures  ripping the meat out of stories and regurgitating them here for you. And , while most journalism school graduates probably dream of breaking stories rather than aggregating them , I didn  t go to j-school , and I rather enjoy the roadkill. There are times , however , when this system  thousands of people clacking away at their laptops , re-reporting a story without fact-checking the original work  breaks down. Remember shade balls ? This is one of those stories. Media all over the country ( including us ) reported on L.A.  s latest attempt to curb the effects of the California drought. In short , the city dumped 96 million black plastic balls in the L.A. Reservoir to slow evaporation of the quickly dwindling water supply. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti held a press conference and dumped 20,000 balls on his own , and the media jumped on it. The Times headline read , In California , Millions of Shade Balls  Combat a Nagging Drought.  The Washington Posts read , Plastic shade balls  : The hypnotizing tool California is using to save water.  It was covered everywhere from BuzzFeed to National Geographic , and it was largely reported as a story of human innovation. It also gave aggregators a chance to make ball jokes , and human innovation and ball jokes both do well on the internet. Those balls got a lot of clicks. The problem is , it wasn  t entirely true. In an article titled Shade balls are a really stupid way to conserve water ,  LA Weekly reports that the city has actually been using shade balls since 2008 , well before the drought began , and they aren  t actually designed to prevent evaporation at all. Rather , they are used to block the formation of a carcinogen called bromate. The LA Times wrote in 2008 : The water needs to be shaded because when sunlight mixes with the bromide and chlorine in [ the reservoir  s ] water , the carcinogen bromate forms , said Pankaj Parekh , DWP  s director for water quality compliance. Bromide is naturally present in groundwater and chlorine is used to kill bacteria , he said , but sunlight is the final ingredient in the potentially harmful mix. Yup. Not about evaporation. So why did this story take off ? Or , in aggregator speak , why did this quick hit have legs ? LA Weekly writes : Well , Garcetti  s office cannily realized that a connection to the drought would provide an excellent hook , especially for national outlets which are always on the lookout for their next kooky California  story. ( Look at those Californians ! They  re running out of water ! Hahaha !  ) In their press release , Garcetti  s office noted that the shade balls will save 300 million gallons of water a year , which otherwise would be lost to evaporation. Sounds like a lot. But how much is 300 million gallons of water worth ? About $ 2 million at current rates. The cost of the shade balls ? $ 34.5 million. It  s not a magic water-saving tactic ; it  s a PR move. And this isn  t the only problem with shade balls. Max Liboiron , a professor who studies marine pollution at Memorial University of Newfoundland , did a deep dive ( aggregator speak ) into the story , and wrote : The black additive [ in the balls ] is carbon black , which isn  t supposed to be harmful when it leaches , which is great. Yet even with this precaution , most plastics leach endocrine disrupting chemicals that interfere with animal and human hormone systems ( Yang 2011 ) . Some endocrine disruptors , like bisphenol A ( BPA ) , break down in water after a few weeks or months. Some don  t. We don  t know what chemicals are in the Shade Balls , but they will leach , especially because the balls are in the hot sun and are meant to be left in the water over a long period ( reports say 10 years ) . Most water treatment systems don  t take these kinds of chemicals out of the water. If endocrine-disrupting plastics leaching into the water supply wasn  t enough to worry about , there  s also the environmental impact. Liboiron writes : Most plastics found in the marine environment start out as larger objects you would easily recognize , like plastic bags and toothbrushes. Or balls. Over time , they fragment into tiny microplastics. 92 % of the 5.25 trillion plastic pieces floating on the surface of oceans ( Eriksen 2014 ) are smaller than a grain of rice because plastics don  t decay into their constituent molecules like organic substances. Instead , they fragment into smaller and smaller bits. Those smaller and smaller bits are then consumed by you in your drinking water , as well as by the fish that you eat , the whales that you watch , the sea lions that show up at your bar demanding a drink. Remember a couple years ago when we stopped buying face wash with microbeads ? There  s a reason. That  s because microplastics are really bad for the environment and the food chain. To be sure , shade balls will prevent evaporation. But the 300 million gallons a year these plastic balls are supposed to save is really not a whole lot , especially compared to the amount of water used by industry and agriculture. Fracking alone uses 2.14 million gallons of fresh water in California every day , Liboiron writes , and if the agriculture industry cut its water use by only 5 percent , that would save 500 billion gallons in a matter of months. But , instead of large cuts  instead of dealing with the root of the problem  we have shade balls. The question is , will they be worth the cost ?"

A spokesperson for the New York City Fire Department says firefighters responded to the home on 252nd Street in Queens around 6 : 30 p.m. and found the house on fire. Officials did not reveal the victim  s identity. Get push notifications with news , features and more. The spokesperson described the woman as a hoarder , and said officials would likely have been able to rescue her if her home had not been so cluttered.  Stuff was piled three to four feet high and throughout ,  he tells PEOPLE. It was normal household items that people might gather , newspapers , magazines  garbage that wasn  t discarded , blankets and bedding.  According to ABC7 , the blaze broke out on the first floor of the woman  s home. It took fire crews nearly an hour to control the fire , and another FDNY spokesperson said eight firefighters were injured battling the blaze in heavy clutter conditions.  The initial spokesperson said the clutter likely fueled the fire and kept Hebling from getting out. They found the woman in the kitchen area of the home and officials pronounced her dead at the scene. Officials have ruled the fire an accident , determining that an extension cord started the blaze. A neighbor , Abdeel Cyril , described the woman to the New York Post as a classic hoarder.  I  ve been inside and I got scared. Just piles and piles of newspapers ,  Cyril said.

Steve Scalise , the No. 2 House Republican , endorsed Stefanik for the post on Wednesday. House Republicans could vote to remove Cheney as soon as Wednesday , reports the AP. ( Read more Kevin McCarthy stories. )|||||House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Monday sent a letter to House Republicans telling them to expect a vote in their Wednesday conference meeting to remove Rep. Liz Cheney as the conference chair. The letter comes after it became clear Republicans would make such a move during their regularly-scheduled meeting amid increasing discontent with Cheney , R-Wyo. McCarthy , R-Calif. , last week was already making calls to clear the field for Rep. Elise Stefanik , R-N.Y. , to replace Cheney. "" Just as we serve at the will of our constituents , this leadership team should exist to serve you , not the other way around , "" McCarthy wrote to GOP House members Monday. "" Unfortunately , each day spent relitigating the past is one day less we have to seize the future. "" McCarthy added : "" Having heard from so many of you in recent days , it  s clear that we need to make a change. As such , you should anticipate a vote on recalling the Conference Chair this Wednesday. "" KINZINGER DEFENDS CHENEY , SAYS MCCARTHY IGNORED WARNINGS ABOUT JAN. 6 VIOLENCE Cheney voted to impeach former President Donald Trump and vocally blamed Trump ' s false claims that the presidential election was stolen for the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. That vote and those comments led to an attempt to remove her as conference chair earlier this year , which she easily survived with the help of McCarthy. But as many Republicans have worked to rehabilitate the image of the former president -- and made the political calculation that the party cannot succeed in the midterms without his backing -- discontent with Cheney has slowly grown. As other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have seemed to move on to direct their fire at President Biden , Cheney has continued to lambaste Trump and said the GOP needs to distance itself from him. This has led to awkward moments with other House leaders , brewing discontent among rank-and-file members and a schism that seemed to irreparably explode at House Republicans ' policy retreat in Florida late last month. Cheney , for her part , has not backed down from her position that Republicans must denounce Trump ' s false election claims , which he ' s continued to relitigate as recently as Monday. "" The question before us now is whether we will join Trump  s crusade to delegitimize and undo the legal outcome of the 2020 election , with all the consequences that might have , "" she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week. HOW LIZ CHENEY LOST REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AHEAD OF VOTE THIS WEEK "" While embracing or ignoring Trump  s statements might seem attractive to some for fundraising and political purposes , that approach will do profound long-term damage to our party and our country , "" she added. "" Trump has never expressed remorse or regret for the attack of Jan. 6 and now suggests that our elections , and our legal and constitutional system , cannot be trusted to do the will of the people. "" When asked whether it was time for Trump to let go of his election gripes on Monday , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , said "" we ' re gonna do both things at once , it looks like , complain and look at the future. "" McCarthy in his Monday letter continued to say that although Republicans consider themselves a "" big tent party , "" focusing on Trump ' s false election claims in the way Cheney has harms Republicans ' ability to win future elections. "" We are a big tent party. We represent Americans of all backgrounds and continue to grow our movement by the day. And unlike the left , we embrace free thought and debate , "" McCarthy said. "" All members are elected to represent their constituents as they see fit , but our leadership team cannot afford to be distracted from the important work we were elected to do and the shared goals we hope to achieve , "" McCarthy added. "" The stakes are too high to come up short. "" REP. ELISE STEFANIK COULD BE ONE-TERM GOP CONFERENCE CHAIR IF SHE BEATS LIZ CHENEY A vote on Cheney can be called by a group of 50 members with a signed petition -- or by McCarthy himself. It ' s unclear , however , that Republicans will move immediately to replace Cheney with Stefanik , who has emerged as a peerless frontrunner for the conference chair position. Stefanik has loudly defended Trump in her rhetoric but some members are concerned about her voting record , which they point out is not particularly conservative. Others think McCarthy is moving too fast. One member said that immediately installing Stefanik Republicans would take away from main point of what Republicans plan to do Wednesday -- ousting Cheney for insufficient loyalty to Trump. "" You step on the lede if you replace Liz right away. This should be about Liz Cheney , you  re fired ,  "" one member said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cheney ' s team , meanwhile , says that Wednesday ' s vote is about whether House Republicans will officially back Trump ' s false election claims and by extension the Jan. 6 attack.

Roughly 14,000 coastal commercial properties assessed at a value of nearly $ 18.5 billion also are at risk during that timeframe. By the end of the century , 2.4 million homes and 107,000 commercial properties currently worth more than $ 1 trillion altogether could be at risk , with Florida  s coastal real estate among the most exposed. The analysis combines property data from the online real estate company Zillow with a peer-reviewed methodology developed by UCS for assessing areas at risk of frequent flooding. Using three sea level rise scenarios developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and localized for this analysis , UCS determined how many residential and commercial properties along the entire lower 48 coastline are at risk of becoming chronically inundated from high tides  flooding on average 26 times per year or more ( or the equivalent of once every other week )  in the coming decades even in the absence of major storms. The core results in the report are from the high sea level rise scenario  an appropriately conservative projection to use when estimating risk to homes , which are often the owner  s single biggest asset. This scenario projects an average of 1.8 feet of sea level rise for Florida in 2045 and 6.4 feet in 2100. The analysis also projects how many properties might avoid such flooding if sea level rise is constrained through the achievement of the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement and if ice loss is limited. The results for Florida are quite sobering. The analysis finds that without additional measures to adapt to rising seas : Florida , of all coastal states in the lower 48 , has the most homes at risk this century. By 2045 , about 64,000 of today  s residential Florida properties , currently home to more than 100,000 people , are at risk of chronic inundation. Miami , the Florida Keys and the Tampa-St. Petersburg area stand out as being highly exposed within the next 30 years. This number jumps to more than 1 million properties at risk by 2100  about 10 percent of the state  s current residential properties and home to approximately 2.1 million people today. More than 40 percent of the nation  s homes at risk in 2100 are in Florida. Fifteen to 20 percent of the at-risk homes in Florida in 2045 and 2100 were built after the year 2000 , which speaks to recent , ongoing development in flood-prone locations despite clear indications of risk. The total value , in today  s dollars , of Florida  s at-risk properties is the largest of any coastal state. By 2045 , about $ 26 billion-worth of residential properties are at risk of chronic flooding. The million-plus homes that would face this flooding at the end of the century are currently worth more than $ 351 billion. Florida  s municipalities could take a large hit to their property tax revenues in 2045 and the greatest hit of all coastal states in the lower 48 at the end of the century. The homes at risk in 2045 currently contribute nearly $ 350 million in annual property tax revenue. The homes at risk by 2100 currently contribute roughly $ 5 billion collectively in annual property tax revenue. Nearly 100 ZIP code areas in Florida  including much of the greater Miami , Tampa and St. Petersburg areas  have at-risk properties that , today , represent 40 percent or more of the property tax base. Some of the Florida communities facing significant risk in the next 30 years are home to people that may be at an inherent disadvantage to prevent or recover from chronic flooding due to longstanding social and economic inequities. In 2045 , there are seven Florida communities with at least 500 homes are at risk  Miami , Miami Beach , Fort Myers , West Palm Beach , and three in the Florida Keys  where Latino populations exceed the national average. Florida ranks second in 2045 and first in 2100 for the most commercial properties at risk in the lower 48. By 2045 , about 2,300 of today  s commercial properties , currently assessed at more than $ 3 billion , are expected to experience chronic inundation. In 2100 , this number jumps to more than 37,500 properties assessed at roughly $ 46 billion today. Approximately 35 percent of the nation  s commercial properties at risk at the end of the century are in Florida. If nations adhere to the primary goal of the Paris Agreement  capping warming to below 2 degrees Celsius  and there is limited loss of land-based ice , about 93 percent of Florida  s at-risk homes would avoid chronic flooding by the end of the century , thus safeguarding the vast majority of property values and annual property tax revenue. Once market risk perceptions catch up with reality , the potential drop in Florida  s coastal property values could have reverberations throughout the economy  affecting banks , insurers , investors , and developers  potentially triggering regional housing market crises. Homeowners whose properties become chronically inundated may find themselves with mortgages that exceed the value of their homes or face steeply rising flood insurance premiums and may end up defaulting on their loans. Lenders carrying large numbers of these risky mortgages could lose money or even become insolvent , with smaller banks concentrated in areas with high flood risk being especially exposed. Coastal real estate investors and developers may similarly experience financial losses in some coastal areas. There are currently many federal , state and local policies that , while originally well intentioned , mask risk and create incentives that reinforce the status quo or even expose more people and property to risk. The market  s bias toward short-term decision-making and profits can also perpetuate risky development and investment choices. These flawed policies and incentives include incomplete or outdated flood risk information , subsidized insurance , lax zoning and building codes , incentives for business-as-usual building and re-building , and incomplete credit ratings. Identifying and improving upon the most important policies and market drivers of risky coastal development is a necessary , powerful way to better protect communities and move Florida and the nation toward greater resilience. Some coastal communities in Florida will also have to consider retreat to higher ground , given the high exposure to flooding in coming decades. Policies and resources must be targeted in an equitable way to create viable options for residents in these high-risk communities. To view the report PDF , click here.

Loss of business , corrosion to your car  s fuel and brake components , floor and drywall replacement , and plumbing and septic-tank backups are just the beginning. What we have to do is flatten the curve of sea-level rise , which began more than 50 years ago. As seas get warmer , they expand. Add melting glaciers , and we are getting a significant rise in sea levels. Even if our greenhouse-gas emissions are flattened today , the seas will continue to rise , very gradually flattening. It  s known as baked-in sea-level rise. Eventually , the curve can flatten , but not until well after 2100. The best-case scenario for the decades ahead is for a rise of 2 to 3 feet. Imagine what a nuisance that will be. South Florida can  t afford any more delays in taking action. To mitigate sea-level rise , the global emissions curve must be reversed. Former Florida Sen. Bill Nelson knew this , but was voted out of office. We need national and international policies to accomplish this. It  s great to reduce our carbon footprints , it  s a gateway to action and learning effective ways to scale up advocacy for limiting emissions. $ 2 for 2 months Subscribe for unlimited access to our website , app , eEdition and more CLAIM OFFER You can make a profound difference on big issues with your voice as a citizen. You probably haven  t because you  re skeptical about politics , especially national politics. If you find an organization committed to forcing change , you can make a profound difference. I found that organization three years ago. Citizens  Climate Lobby advocates for carbon fee and dividend legislation. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act , HR 763 , a bill introduced by Florida U.S. Rep Ted Deutch , a Democrat , and Republican Rep. Francis Rooney is our favorite. The bill proposes a reduction of greenhouse-gas pollution with a fee on fossil fuels. That , in turn , would spur innovation and trigger investment in cleaner and more efficient energy. All the money collected from the fee would be distributed in equal shares every month to all U.S. families to compensate for increases in electricity and fuel prices. It would create jobs and reduce illness.The government would not keep any of the money from the fee. This bill would apply tariffs and rebates on international trade to use America  s economic power to influence our trading partners to also price fossil fuels accordingly. Get out and vote for politicians who want this bill to become law. Jeff Dorian is president of the Broward Chapter of Citizens  Climate Lobby. The Invading Sea  is the opinion arm of the Florida Climate Reporting Network , a collaborative of news organizations across the state focusing on the threats posed by the warming climate .|||||In this paper , we explore dynamic changes in the capitalization of sea level rise ( SLR ) risk in housing and mortgage markets. Our results suggest a disconnect in coastal Florida real estate : From 2013-2018 , home sales volumes in the most-SLR-exposed communities declined 16-20 % relative to less-SLR-exposed areas , even as their sale prices grew in lockstep. Between 2018-2020 , however , relative prices in these at-risk markets finally declined by roughly 5 % from their peak. Lender behavior cannot reconcile these patterns , as we show that both all-cash and mortgage-financed purchases have similarly contracted , with little evidence of increases in loan denial or securitization. We propose a demand-side explanation for our findings where prospective buyers have become more pessimistic about climate change risk than prospective sellers. The lead-lag relationship between transaction volumes and prices in SLR-exposed markets is consistent with dynamics at the peak of prior real estate bubbles ."
